447	he suddenly remembered the reason he had written to sirius, and for a moment was on the verge of telling ron and hermione about his scar hurting again, and about the dream that had awoken him ... but he really didn't want to worry them just now, not when he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful.	1
4450	i can try, said ron doubtfully. better not make it sound like i reckon crouch is up to anything dodgy, though. percy loves crouch.	1
1153	hedwig, dear? said mrs. weasley distractedly.  no. . . no, there hasn't been any post at all.	1
3493	harry looked around the hall.  hagrid was sitting at one of the other staff tables; he was back in his horrible hairy brown suit and gazing up at the top table.  harry saw him give a small wave, and looking around, saw madame maxime return it, her opals glittering in the candlelight.	1
11264	as persons in our own day are apt to fancy that a statement is verified	0
8652	women showing their agility in the palaestra will certainly not be a	0
2273	harry moved off along the teachers' table.  hagrid was seated right at the end.  he did not wink at harry, or wave, or give any of his usual signs of greeting.  he looked completely astonished and stared at harry as he passed like everyone else.  harry went through the door out of the great hall and found himself in a smaller room, lined with paintings of witches and wizards.  a handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace opposite him.	1

2501	it was lucky, perhaps, that both harry and ron started shouting at snape at the same time; lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for in the confused din, it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling him.  he got the gist, however.	1
202	normal for us, said harry, and before his uncle could stop him, he added, you know, owl post. that's what's normal for wizards.	1

17626	of which we were just now speaking, and his whole life is passed in	0
17792	arms and appurtenances were manufactured; when they were completed, the	0
2769	- and reading between the lines of that skeeter woman's article last month, moody was attacked the night before he started at hogwarts.  yes, i know she says it was another false alarm, sirius said hastily, seeing harry about to speak, but i don't think so, somehow.  i think someone tried to stop him from getting to hogwarts.  i think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around.  and no one's going to look into it too closely; mad-eye's heard intruders a bit too often.  but that doesn't mean he can't still spot the real thing.  moody was the best auror the ministry ever had.	1

5857	no spell can reawaken the dead, said dumbledore heavily. all that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo.  a shadow of the living cedric would have emerged from the wand . . . am i correct, harry?	1

13464	which developes the stages of the idea in different countries or at	0

6150	yeah, said harry and ron slowly.	1

18650	and what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence of	0

18300	the city either the one or the other.	0
5174	malfoy was holding a copy of the daily prophet too. slytherins up and down the table were sniggering, twisting in their seats to see harry's reaction.	1
5588	harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come.  there was no hope ... no help to be had.  and as he heard voldemort draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason:  he was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die kneeling at voldemort s feet... he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defense was possible. . . .	1
14419	'hope,' he says, 'cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice	0
18339	in your opinion, is not the courage which the law ordains, and ought to	0
6424	the warp and the woof which run through the whole texture. and when the	0

23078	also in their penurious, laborious character; the individual only	0
8020	good deal their views of primitive history to their own notions of good	0
24801	as they are or as they appear? you have still to determine this.	0
3067	what? oh yeah . . . ouch . . . interesting, said harry as she stepped on his foot.	1
9879	relative to human needs and opinions; and the mathematical sciences are	0
5413	from far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say, kill the spare.	1
17088	we were saying, when we spoke of the subject-matter, that we had no need	0
16828	enough of the subjects of poetry: let us now speak of the style; and	0
20915	at whose side they may fight and be saved. such an one may be compared	0
14047	the mother; yea and that also in good earnest: peace, son, saith she,	0
13522	them; they rather wish to rest than to pursue high objects. a few	0
4672	you stay here with him!  harry said to krum.  i'll get dumbledore, i'll be quicker, i know where his office is -	1
21474	different degrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the	0
21514	i understand, he said, that you are speaking of the province of geometry	0
21161	i omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women, and the	0
11352	counsels? or is any invention attributed to you, as there is to thales	0
24081	very true, i said. but imagine one of these owners, the master say of	0
6830	the thieving must be for the good of friends and the harm of enemies.	0
2117	once the golden plates had been wiped clean, dumbledore stood up again.  a pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the hall now.  harry felt a slight thrill of excitement, wondering what was coming.  several seats down from them, fred and george were leaning forward, staring at dumbledore with great concentration.	1
3267	who d'you two keep writing to, eh?  said ron.	1
1771	right. . . anyone know any others?	1
19064	for what purpose do you conceive that we have come here, said	0
15545	evil; but that the evil is greater than the good. and so when men have	0
16832	then i must make you understand; and perhaps i may be more intelligible	0
7067	which are desirable for their results only. socrates answers that this	0
7748	and, if i am not mistaken, he nowhere mentions sweet sauces. sicilian	0
20866	was the doer of any great thing either to individuals or to states.	0
4857	look, said harry impatiently, let's say sirius is right, and someone stunned krum to kidnap crouch.  well, they would've been in the trees near us, wouldn't they?  but they waited till i was out of the way until they acted, didn't they?  so it doesn't look like i'm their target, does it?	1
15091	then the pay is not derived by the several artists from their respective	0
802	one hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two seekers, krum and lynch, plummeted through the center of the chasers, so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes. harry followed their descent through his omnioculars, squinting to see where the snitch was -	1

1855	it's just an expression, said ron hastily.	1
4418	for a moment, the deadened look in sirius's eyes became more pronounced than ever, as though shutters had closed behind them.	1
22829	also castles which are just nests for their eggs, and in which they will	0

23257	there never will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used	0

9987	sun and stars in the water, the stars and sun themselves, severally	0
5968	of course you can, said mrs. weasley.  she was white to the lips, but she looked resolute.  we know what fudge is.  it's arthur's fondness for muggles that has held him back at the ministry all these years.  fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride.	1
4770	i've told you, harry repeated dully.  he said he's getting stronger.	1
15817	find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice--beginning with	0
25323	unrefuted, let us never say that fever, or any other disease, or the	0

20917	wickedness of his fellows, but neither is he able singly to resist all	0
21821	ascent from below, which we affirm to be true philosophy?	0
23699	why, because he is the author of the pregnant saying,	0
18626	then none of these objections will confuse us, or incline us to believe	0
20957	difficult; and what still remains is the reverse of easy.	0
1213	harry repacked his broomstick servicing kit, put his firebolt over his shoulder, and went back upstairs with ron.  the rain sounded even louder at the top of the house, accompanied by loud whistlings and moans from the wind, not to mention sporadic howls from the ghoul who lived in the attic.  pigwidgeon began twittering and zooming around his cage when they entered. the sight of the half-packed trunks seemed to have sent him into a frenzy of excitement.	1
21741	will be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have	0
2297	no, said harry.  he was very aware of everybody watching him closely.  snape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the shadows.	1
9953	opinions every day; he soon begins to believe nothing, and brings	0
9558	the remark that the salvation of any remnant of good in the present evil	0
19275	the other, after much study and application, no sooner learns than he	0
1767	harry looked around at her.  she was looking, not at the spider, but at neville, and harry, following her gaze, saw that neville's hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes wide and horrified.	1

24612	exercise over children, and the refusal to let them be free until we	0
8900	is a third thing, which both is and is not, and is matter of opinion	0

6054	madame maxime was still there.  she was sitting next to hagrid.  they were talking quietly together.  further along the table, sitting next to professor mcgonagall, was snape.  his eyes lingered on harry for a moment as harry looked at him.  his expression was difficult to read.  he looked as sour and unpleasant as ever.  harry continued to watch him, long after snape had looked away.	1
13052	the perfection and unity of god was a far higher conception than his	0
12152	citizens of the timocratic rather than of the ideal state. the council	0
5722	moody raised his wand, he opened his mouth; harry plunged his own hand into his robes -	1
237	i'll be at ron's when you get back, all right? harry told her.	1
13463	them: for whereas hegel is thinking of all the minds of men as one mind,	0

17472	of that, he replied, there can be no doubt; such excessive care of the	0
21805	are, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight.	0

7664	of women, quarrelling, weeping, scolding, or boasting against the	0
14449	according to you truly say, about justice?	0
3890	but he suddenly realized what he was saying, and he felt the excitement drain out of him as though someone had just pulled a plug in his stomach.  he wasn't a very good swimmer; he'd never had much practice.  dudley had had lessons in his youth, but aunt petunia and uncle vernon, no doubt hoping that harry would drown one day, hadn't bothered to give him any.  a couple of lengths of this bath were all very well, but that lake was very large, and very deep . . . and merpeople would surely live right at the bottom. . . .	1
3551	vare is herm-own-ninny? said a voice.	1
10981	relative terms, and no crimes which are committed by them approach those	0
3368	right, said ron, who looked extremely put out, this is getting stupid.  ginny, you can go with harry, and i'll just -	1
7285	happiness will be the inseparable accident which attends him. 'seek ye	0
23261	promoting to honour any one who professes to be the people's friend.	0
5253	i'm okay, said harry.  it was sort of true; he was nervous, but he kept running over all the hexes and spells he had been practicing in his mind as they walked, and the knowledge that he could remember them all made him feel better.	1

4381	we saw him in the forest just before the dark mark appeared, hermione told sirius. remember?  she said to harry and ron.	1

6576	(to use a platonic expression) will 'shut him up.' he has reached the	0
7807	at fault, for he foolishly imagines that every one is as bad as himself.	0
14279	timaeus, hermocrates, critias, and a nameless person, who are introduced	0
14548	would say that justice is useful; but when you want to use them, then	0
19212	acknowledged--did we not? that different natures ought to have different	0
6650	portions of the dialogue. for example, throughout the greater part	0
25531	ourselves witnessed. we were at the mouth of the cavern, and, having	0
22219	there is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach, and which our	0
4425	there was a long silence.  harry was thinking of the way crouch's eyes had bulged as he'd looked down at his disobedient house-elf back in the wood at the quidditch world cup. this, then, must have been why crouch had overreacted to winky being found beneath the dark mark.  it had brought back memories of his son, and the old scandal, and his fall from grace at the ministry.	1
4298	harry could feel his face burning.  snape was pausing at the end of every sentence to allow the slytherins a hearty laugh.  the article sounded ten times worse when read by snape. even hermione was blushing scarlet now.	1
1671	i don't think so! roared moody, pointing his wand at the ferret again - it flew ten feet into the air, fell with a smack to the floor, and then bounced upward once more.	1

4891	you were clutching your scar!  said professor trelawney.  you were rolling on the floor, clutching your scar!  come now.  potter, i have experience in these matters!	1
12598	duty and conscience, under these or other names, are always reappearing.	0
2634	it was cho.  harry felt the color rising in his face.	1
1620	except, of course, for that time at the end of last term, when she had made the prediction about voldemort rising again. . . and dumbledore himself had said that he thought that trance had been genuine, when harry had described it to him.	1
18216	and in what they differ from one another, and which of them the man who	0
4655	dumbledore! gasped mr. crouch. he reached out and seized a handful of harrys robes, dragging him closer, though his eyes were staring over harry's head.  i need... see ... dumbledore. ...	1
22490	them by the help of dialectic, in order to learn which of them is able	0

13887	seemed so natural and congenial. he speaks, or rather preaches, from the	0
2148	you! he said, staring at moody as though unsure he was really seeing him.	1
25186	who say these things--they are excellent people, as far as their lights	0
15534	of itself; then i shall be satisfied, and you are the person from whom	0

20612	at finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities; explain	0

20150	once more let me ask: does he who desires any class of goods, desire the	0

20110	i ought to try, i said, since you offer me such invaluable assistance.	0
14000	this saving clause, and not rudely withdraw the veil behind which he has	0
12804	occurred to him that the greater part of them, according to universal	0
6079	he looked around. fleur delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. beyond her, far across the grounds. harry could see hagrid helping madame maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness.  the beauxbatons carriage was about to take off.	1

21529	they are termed, which proceed from hypotheses only: these are also	0

16542	prophecy, would not fail. and now he himself who uttered the strain,	0
21976	the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude?	0

2324	we all know professor moody considers the morning wasted if he hasn't discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime, said karkaroff loudly.  apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too.  an odd quality in a defense against the dark arts teacher, dumbledore, but no doubt you had your reasons.	1
8438	difficulty is to determine whether the several principles are one or	0
15597	as the actions of the unjust; they would both come at last to the same	0
4635	he couldn't quite believe he was having this conversation with viktor krum, the famous international quidditch player.  it was as though the eighteen-year-old krum thought he. harry, was an equal - a real rival -	1
16839	that again, he said, i do not quite understand.	0
19281	and can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has not	0
6413	construction of the state is the principal argument of the work. the	0
3272	angelina, said fred promptly, without a trace of embarrassment.	1
25277	at last wholly dissolves and dies?	0
6747	and then proceed to consider (1) the general aspects of this hellenic	0
5280	harry approached it cautiously, pointing the wand's beam at it.  this looked like some kind of enchantment.  he wondered whether he might be able to blast it out of the way.	1

10581	parallels between the individuals and the states, tracing the origin of	0
4841	what? said harry.  oh yeah . . .	1

18654	admitting this to be true of desire generally, let us suppose a	0

1344	ron made to stuff the robes out of sight, but malfoy was too quick for him; he seized the sleeve and pulled.	1
4616	harry, who knew only too well the kind of creatures that hagrid was likely to provide for an event like this, thought it was unlikely to be any fun at all.  however, he nodded politely like the other champions.	1
19812	the idea is ridiculous, he said.	0
23819	and now, i said, years will have passed away, and you must conceive this	0

4453	yes, he's quoted in the article in there, said sirius, nodding at the paper. blustering on about how bad bertha's memory is.  well, maybe she's changed since i knew her, but the bertha i knew wasn't forgetful at all - quite the reverse.  she was a bit dim, but she had an excellent memory for gossip.  it used to get her into a lot of trouble; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut.  i can see her being a bit of a liability at the ministry of magic . . . maybe that's why bagman didn't bother to look for her for so long. ...	1

20180	to another, i replied, i might have a difficulty in explaining; but i am	0
3389	despite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth  years had been given for the holidays.  harry was in no mood to work when term ended, and spent the week leading up to christmas enjoying himself as fully as possible along with everyone else.  gryffindor tower was hardly less crowded now than during term-time; it seemed to have shrunk slightly too, as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual.  fred and george had had a great success with their canary creams, and for the first couple of days of the holidays, people kept bursting into feather all over the place.  before long, however, all the gryffindors had learned to treat food anybody else offered them with extreme caution, in case it had a canary cream concealed in the center, and george confided to harry that he and fred were now working on developing something else.  harry made a mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from fred and george in future.  he still hadn't forgotten dudley and the ton-tongue toffee.	1
2645	miss him?  said harry.  i don't miss him. . .	1
5999	he looked slightly paler than usual, and his cold, black eyes glittered strangely.	1

3165	dobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror-struck by his own daring - then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard, squealing, bad dobby! bad dobby!	1
11053	of reputation. reason, again, is solely directed to the attainment of	0
6183	look, he said flatly, take it, or i'll hex you.  i know some good ones now.  just do me one favor, okay?  buy ron some different dress robes and say they're from you.	1

5164	sirius was sending daily owls now. like hermione, he seemed to want to concentrate on getting harry through the last task before they concerned themselves with anything else.  he reminded harry in every letter that whatever might be going on outside the walls of hogwarts was not harry's responsibility, nor was it within his power to influence it.	1
24860	to him, 'if you are only in the second remove from truth in what you say	0

22894	yes, said adeimantus, they give us plenty of them, and their complaints	0
20326	and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance,	0
299	as the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick, this remark didn't go down too well with the dursleys.  uncle vernon's face purpled once more, and aunt petunia started chewing her tongue again.  however, they seemed too scared to actually say anything.	1
10284	which is five, subtracting one from each square or two perfect squares	0
1570	there was a sudden rustling noise above them, and a hundred owls came soaring through the open windows carrying the morning mail.  instinctively, harry looked up, but there was no sign of white among the mass of brown and gray.  the owls circled the tables, looking for the people to whom their letters and packages were addressed.  a large tawny owl soared down to neville longbottom and deposited a parcel into his lap - neville almost always forgot to pack something.  on the other side of the hall draco malfoy's eagle owl had landed on his shoulder, carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from home.  trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach, harry returned to his porridge.  was it possible that something had happened to hedwig, and that sirius hadn't even got his letter?	1
16324	young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he	0
19610	together with the part affected, and we say that the man has a pain in	0
16380	then god, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the many	0
3419	yeah, okay, said harry.  then, spotting the look on hermione's face, he said, come on, how'm i supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on?  i won't even be able to hear the egg over this lot.	1
22603	sacrifices and honour them, if the pythian oracle consent, as demigods,	0

862	at last, when the irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms (aidan lynch on the back of confolly's, clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way), bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered, quietus.	1

2262	harry sat there, aware that every head in the great hall had turned to look at him.  he was stunned.  he felt numb.  he was surely dreaming.  he had not heard correctly.	1

2811	somehow, the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on privet drive with dudley was good to know; it made him feel slightly calmer.  he finished his bacon with difficulty (his throat wasn't working too well), and as he and hermione got up, he saw cedric diggory leaving the hufflepuff table.	1

5836	when harry told of wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger, however, sirius let out a vehement exclamation and dumbledore stood up so quickly that harry started.  dumbledore walked around the desk and told harry to stretch out his arm.  harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them.	1

2406	when harry woke up on sunday morning, it took him a moment to remember why he felt so miserable and worried.  then the memory of the previous night rolled over him.  he sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own four-poster, intending to talk to ron, to force ron to believe him - only to find that ron's bed was empty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast.	1

3512	you don't mind, do you, harry? parvati said.	1
16334	we shall never mention the battles of the giants, or let them be	0
148	a weird thing happened this morning, though. my scar hurt again. last time that happened it was because voldemort was at hogwarts. but i don't reckon he can be anywhere near me now, can he? do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward?	1

20675	you leave words and look at facts, the persons who are thus described	0
12211	may have naturally suggested to plato the possibility of reviving such	0

5679	he took stuff from his father's grave, and from wormtail, and me, said harry.  his head felt clearer; his scar wasn't hurting so badly; he could now see moodys face distinctly, even though the office was dark.  he could still hear screaming and shouting from the distant quidditch field.	1

2126	the instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by mr. crouch and mr. bagman, said dumbledore as filch placed the chest carefully on the table before him, and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge.  there will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different ways.. their magical prowess - their daring - their powers of deduction - and, of course, their ability to cope with danger.	1

15263	and what of the ignorant? would he not desire to have more than either	0

18807	yes, he said, there must be a third.	0
4080	or a frog, yawned harry.  he was exhausted.  it takes years to become an animagus, and then you have to register yourself and everything, said hermione vaguely, now squinting down the index of weird wizarding dilemmas and their solutions.  professor mcgonagall told us, remember... you've got to register yourself with the improper use of magic office ...what animal you become, and your markings, so you can't abuse it...	1

2058	blooming, thank you, professor karkaroff, dumbledore replied.  karkaroff had a fruity, unctuous voice; when he stepped into the light pouring from the front doors of the castle they saw that he was tall and thin like dumbledore, but his white hair was short, and his goatee (finishing in a small curl) did not entirely hide his rather weak chin.  when he reached dumbledore, he shook hands with both of his own.	1

3646	snow was still thick upon the grounds, and the greenhouse windows were covered in condensation so thick that they couldn't see out of them in herbology.  nobody was looking forward to care of magical creatures much in this weather, though as ron said, the skrewts would probably warm them up nicely, either by chasing them, or blasting off so forcefully that hagrid's cabin would catch fire.	1

3237	she didn' seem very int'rested in magical creatures, ter tell yeh the truth, hagrid said, when harry, ron, and hermione asked him how his interview with rita skeeter had gone during the last care of magical creatures lesson of the term.  to their very great relief, hagrid had given up on direct contact with the skrewts now, and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today, sitting at a trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to tempt the skrewts.	1

4033	this class was an ideal cover for a private conversation, as everyone was having far too much fun to pay them any attention.  harry had been recounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour.	1

5060	you mean . . . that stuff's your thoughts?  harry said, staring at the swirling white substance in the basin.	1
3204	lavender brown let out a shrill giggle.  parvati patil nudged her hard in the ribs, her face working furiously as she too fought not to giggle.  they both looked around at harry, professor mcgonagall ignored them, which harry thought was distinctly unfair, as she had just told off him and ron.	1
676	well, they'll never replace brooms in britain, will they?  said bagman.	1
25044	we may state the question thus:--imitation imitates the actions of men,	0
13223	truths, and insensibly to learn the lesson of good manners and good	0
21105	indeed, he said, in no way could they make a fairer picture.	0
2866	my second piece of general advice, said moody loudly, interrupting him, is to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to get what you need.	1

4861	the hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when harry had to stay indoors. for the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library with hermione and ron, looking up hexes, or else in empty classrooms, which they sneaked into to practice.  harry was concentrating on the stunning spell, which he had never used before.  the trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on ron's and hermione's part.	1

3211	professor mcgonagall called above the noise, potter - a word, if you please.	1

19408	what they mean to do when their wish has come true--that is a way which	0

5286	the world turned upside down.  harry was hanging from the ground, with his hair on end, his glasses dangling off his nose, threatening to fall into the bottomless sky.  he clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there, terrified.  it felt as though his feet were glued to the grass, which had now become the ceiling.  below him the dark, star-spangled heavens stretched endlessly.  he felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet, he would fall away from the earth completely.	1

1967	harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an extra-thorough cleaning. several grimy portraits had been scrubbed, much to the displeasure of their subjects, who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly and wincing as they felt their raw pink faces. the suits of armor were suddenly gleaming and moving without squeaking, and argus filch, the caretaker, was behaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he terrified a pair of first-year girls into hysterics.	1

3847	he could tell at once that they carried different sorts of bubble bath mixed with the water, though it wasn't bubble bath as harry had ever experienced it.  one tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of footballs; another poured ice-white foam so thick that harry thought it would have supported his weight if he'd cared to test it; a third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering over the surface of the water.  harry amused himself for awhile turning the taps on and off, particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs.  then, when the deep pool was full of hot water, foam, and bubbles, which took a very short time considering its size, harry turned off all the taps, pulled off his pajamas, slippers, and dressing gown, and slid into the water.	1

1917	moody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the imperius curse upon them.  harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence.  dean thomas hopped three times around the room, singing the national anthem. lavender brown imitated a squirrel.  neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state.  not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of them recovered only when moody had removed it.	1

348	before any of them could say anything else, there was a faint popping noise, and mr. weasley appeared out of thin air at george's shoulder.  he was looking angrier than harry had ever seen him.	1
1485	hermione had knocked over her golden goblet.  pumpkin juice spread steadily over the tablecloth, staining several feet of white linen orange, but hermione paid no attention.	1

929	what's up with her? said ron, looking curiously after winky.  why can't she run properly?	1
5564	wormtail approached harry, who scrambled to find his feet, to support his own weight before the ropes were untied.  wormtail raised his new silver hand, pulled out the wad of material gagging harry, and then, with one swipe, cut through the bonds tying harry to the gravestone.	1
1188	well, father feels he's got to make up for his mistake at the match, doesn't he? said percy. if truth be told, he was a tad unwise to make a public statement without clearing it with his head of department first -	1

1482	yeah, we thought peeves seemed hacked off about something, said ron darkly.  so what did he do in the kitchens?	1
2745	harry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and hay very still, staring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit.  he recognized the goatee. . . it was karkaroff.	1

3026	what was that?  said seamus finnigan, staring at the egg as harry slammed it shut again.  sounded like a banshee ... maybe you've got to get past one of those next, harry!	1
3446	what, you need three hours?  said ron, looking at her incredulously and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball, thrown by george, hit him hard on the side of the head.  who're you going with?  he yelled after hermione, but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle.	1

2294	 thank you, severus, said dumbledore firmly, and snape went quiet, though his eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain of greasy black hair.	1
306	he and ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming.  dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off.  mr. weasley, however, seemed genuinely concerned at dudley's peculiar behavior.  indeed, from the tone of his voice when he next spoke, harry was quite sure that mr. weasley thought dudley was quite as mad as the dursleys thought he was, except that mr. weasley felt sympathy rather than fear.	1

605	ah, why shouldn't we show our colors?  said mrs. finnigan.  you should see what the bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents.  you'll be supporting ireland, of course? she added, eyeing harry, ron, and hermione beadily.  when they had assured her that they were indeed supporting ireland, they set off again, though, as ron said, like we'd say anything else surrounded by that lot. i wonder what the bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents?  said hermione.	1
3635	ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the girls' staircase to bed. ron turned to look at harry.	1

25478	speak, he said; there are few things which i would more gladly hear.	0

18977	and do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to vice?	0
3631	the fat lady and her friend vi were snoozing in the picture over the portrait hole. harry had to yell fairy lights! before he woke them up, and when he did, they were extremely irritated.  he climbed into the common room and found ron and hermione having a blazing row.  standing ten feet apart, they were bellowing at each other, each scarlet in the face.	1
192	he had almost said hogwarts express, and that was a sure way to get his uncle's temper up.  nobody ever mentioned the name of harry's school aloud in the dursley household.	1

1424	while still alive they did divide	1
847	ireland wins!  bagman shouted, who like the irish, seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of the match.	1
5867	harry suddenly became aware that fawkes had left his knee.  the phoenix had fluttered to the floor.  it was resting its beautiful head against  harry's injured leg, and thick, pearly tears were falling from its eyes onto the wound left by the spider.  the pain vanished.  the skin mended.  his leg was repaired.	1

11780	he had not been deterred by other pursuits' (tim.) thus from many points	0
5401	they had left the hogwarts grounds completely; they had obviously traveled miles - perhaps hundreds of miles - for even the mountains surrounding the castle were gone.  they were standing instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard; the black outline of a small church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right.  a hill rose above them to their left. harry could just make out the outline of a fine old house on the hillside.	1
1834	lose a treasured possession, said harry, who was flicking through unfogging the future for ideas.	1

4212	harry felt both stupid and annoyed.  it was all very well for ron; he'd been asleep, he hadn't felt how eerie it was down in the lake, surrounded by spear-carrying merpeople who'd looked more than capable of murder.	1
25929	your written explanation.  the person or entity that provided you with	0
770	harry, what are you doing? said hermione's voice from a long way off.	1
10218	also noticeable. plato is very well aware that the faculty of the	0
3481	and pork chops appeared. getting the idea, the rest of the table placed their orders with their plates too.  harry glanced up at hermione to see how she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining - surely it meant plenty of extra work for the house-elves? - but for once, hermione didn't seem to be thinking about s.p.e.w.  she was deep in talk with viktor krum and hardly seemed to notice what she was eating.	1

12407	in the community, there will be no absurdity in expecting that the	0
403	and have you heard from -?  ron began, but at a look from hermione he fell silent. harry knew ron had been about to ask about sirius.  ron and hermione had been so deeply involved in helping sirius escape from the ministry of magic that they were almost as concerned about harry's godfather as he was.  however, discussing him in front of ginny was a bad idea. nobody but themselves and professor dumbledore knew about how sirius had escaped, or believed in his innocence.	1
17581	which, as we said, inspires temperance, will be reluctant to go to law.	0
14604	very true, he said: and i think that we had better correct an error	0

25506	the things above, and the souls which came from heaven about the things	0

3521	hermione stared at him, then at harry, who shrugged.	1
5750	you is killed him!  you is killed him!  you is killed master's son!	1
6539	socrates, whose love of conversation, no less than the mission imposed	0
22696	yes, he said, the states are as the men are; they grow out of human	0

7812	and the need of either will be greatly diminished by good music which	0

24294	yes, he said; at the time they are pleased and well content to be at	0

4165	harry gave her the thumbs-up to show his thanks and set off once more, careful to swim a bit higher over the weed to avoid any more grindylows that might be lurking there.	1

985	ron - harry - his voice sounded shaky - hermione - are you all right?	1
13178	he has long given up the notion that virtue cannot be taught; and he is	0
8760	all are quickly sensitive; and the least hurt to the little finger of	0
9089	great mischief in states, and sometimes also of great good. and thus	0
8884	he has an insatiable curiosity. 'but will curiosity make a philosopher?	0
20451	and further, i said, let us agree that they are lovers of all true	0

23769	well, he said, it is not too late to supply the omission.	0

5071	yes, said dumbledore, prodding the thoughts in the basin again; bertha sank back into them, and they became silvery and opaque once more.  that was bertha as i remember her at school.	1
4059	dunno, said harry dully.  the momentary happiness that had flared inside him at the sight of the owl had died.  come on ...care of magical creatures.	1

31	he let himself into the cavernous kitchen.  frank had not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his way towards it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead.  he reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick.	1
607	the tents here had not been bedecked with plant life, but each and every one of them had the same poster attached to it, a poster of a very surly face with heavy black eyebrows. the picture was, of course, moving, but all it did was blink and scowl.	1
3828	hagrid got up, went over to his dresser, opened a drawer, and pulled out a picture of a short wizard with hagrid's crinkled black eyes, beaming as he sat on top of hagrid's shoulder. hagrid was a good seven or eight feet tall, judging by the apple tree beside him, but his face was beardless, young, round, and smooth - he looked hardly older than eleven.	1

1305	i'm sure professor dumbledore will tell you. . . . now, behave, won't you?  won't you, fred?  and you, george?	1
882	that's sick, ron muttered, watching the smallest muggle child, who had begun to spin like a top, sixty feet above the ground, his head flopping limply from side to side. that is really sick. . . .	1
10362	nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler, you will find abundance	0
5788	it was very quick.  my father was placed under the imperius curse by my master. now my father was the one imprisoned, controlled.  my master forced him to go about his business as usual, to act as though nothing was wrong.  and i was released.  i awoke.  i was myself again, alive as i hadn't been in years.	1
2188	i've just realized - i haven't asked hagrid to join s.p.e.w. yet!  she said brightly. wait for me, will you, while i nip upstairs and get the badges?	1
20026	seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the third, which	0
8740	the parents ought to be in the prime of life, which for a man may be	0
20116	and are meant to be followers rather than leaders.	0
1892	it's made him think he's got to come back! said harry, now slamming his fist on the table so that hedwig landed on the back of ron's chair, hooting indignantly.  coming back, because he thinks i'm in trouble!  and there's nothing wrong with me!  and i haven't got anything for you, harry snapped at hedwig, who was clicking her beak expectantly, you'll have to go up to the owlery if you want food.	1
5076	well, i had a dream, said harry.  a dream about lord voldemort.  he was torturing wormtail . . . you know who wormtail-	1
17795	to defend her against attacks, and her citizens they are to regard as	0
495	accio! accio! accio! she shouted, and toffees zoomed from all sorts of unlikely places, including the lining of george's jacket and the turn-ups of fred's jeans.	1
8113	definite character and capable of receiving a definite treatment. he is	0
1843	then george looked over and saw harry watching him.  harry grinned and quickly returned to his predictions - he didn't want george to think he was eavesdropping.  shortly after that, the twins rolled up their parchment, said good night, and went off to bed.	1
335	but far from being reassured, the dursleys became more panic- stricken; aunt petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging dudley's tongue as though determined to rip it out; dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue; and uncle vernon, who had lost control completely, seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at mr. weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace.	1
4695	look, said harry angrily, crouch isn't right - he's - he's out of his mind - he says he wants to warn -	1
6166	nope, said george, shaking his head.  the goblins play as dirty as him.  they say you drew with diggory, and bagman was betting you'd win outright.  so bagman had to run for it.  he did run for it right after the third task.	1
20238	and, as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to	0
11165	error. is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man, or	0
11613	leaving the rest. and a man must take with him an iron sense of truth	0
22152	what do you mean? he asked.	0
899	you watch your mouth! shouted ron. everybody present knew that mudblood was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of muggle parentage.	1
12934	meant for mankind,' there have certainly been others who to family	0
21995	carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind	0

2234	the durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from the lake. viktor krum was walking side by side with karkaroff, and the other durmstrang students were straggling along behind them.  ron watched krum excitedly, but krum did not look around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of hermione, ron, and harry and proceeded through them.	1
6	the police were summoned, and the whole of little hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-disguised excitement.  nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the riddles, for they had been most unpopular.  elderly mr. and mrs. riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown-up son, tom, had been, if anything, worse.  all the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer -- for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night.	1
2814	harry, you'll be late, the bell's about to ring -	1

4348	he was still grinning, but seeing the anxiety in harrys face, said more seriously, i want to be on the spot.  your last letter . . . well, let's just say things are getting fishier.  i've been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out, and by the looks of things, i'm not the only one who's getting worried.	1

3645	harry had not forgotten the hint that cedric had given him, but his less-than-friendly feelings toward cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take his help if he could avoid it. in any case, it seemed to him that if cedric had really wanted to give harry a hand, he would have been a lot more explicit. he, harry, had told cedric exactly what was coming in the first task - and cedric's idea of a fair exchange had been to tell harry to take a bath.  well, he didn't need that sort of rubbishy help - not from someone who kept walking down corridors hand in hand with cho, anyway.  and so the first day of the new term arrived, and harry set off to lessons, weighed down with books, parchment, and quills as usual, but also with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his stomach, as though he were carrying that around with him too.	1
10465	breeding, anarchy freedom, waste magnificence, impudence courage. such	0

6071	dumbledore turned gravely to harry and raised his goblet once more.  nearly everyone in the great hall followed suit.  they murmured his name, as they had murmured cedric's, and drank to him.  but through a gap in the standing figures.  harry saw that malfoy, crabbe, goyle, and many of the other slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched.  dumbledore, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see them.	1

15114	how a penalty can be a payment.	0
2602	harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody.  he was very fond of his wand, and as far as he was concerned its relation to voldemort's wand was something it couldn't help - rather as he couldn't help being related to aunt petunia.  however, he really hoped that mr. ollivander wasn't about to tell the room about it.  he had a funny feeling rita skeeter's quick-quotes quill might just explode with excitement if he did.	1

3266	because we want to send a letter, you stupid great prat, said george.	1
5763	the dementors are blind.  they sensed one healthy, one dying person entering azkaban.  they sensed one healthy, one dying person leaving it.  my father smuggled me out, disguised as my mother, in case any prisoners were watching through their doors.	1

23260	never giving a thought to the pursuits which make a statesman, and	0
2878	ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh; he certainly caught harry's eye for the first time in days, but harry was still feeling too resentful toward ron to care.  he spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the table with his wand.  he managed to make a fly zoom straight into his hand, though he wasn't entirely sure that was his prowess at summoning charms - perhaps the fly was just stupid.	1

3450	i still can't work out how you two got the best-looking girls in the year, muttered dean.	1

16921	imitators; or rather, has not this question been decided by the rule	0
1120	the point? said mr. weasley with a hollow laugh.  harry, that's their idea of fun. half the muggle killings back when you-know-who was in power were done for fun.  i suppose they had a few drinks tonight and couldn't resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large.  a nice little reunion for them, he finished disgustedly.	1

11693	he is the enemy of the poets because poetry was declining in his own	0
19066	yes, but discourse should have a limit.	0
12168	fascinated by the idea, citizens of athens would imitate the	0

10156	so absorbed their minds, that they are unable to see in their true	0

2880	at two o'clock in the morning, harry stood near the fireplace, surrounded by heaps of objects:  books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of gobstones, and neville's toad, trevor.  only in the last hour had harry really got the hang of the summoning charm.	1
7708	should be reflected in them all. this principle of simplicity has to	0

2984	you were the best, you know, no competition.  cedric did this weird thing where he transfigured a rock on the ground. . . turned it into a dog. . . he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him.  well, it was a pretty cool bit of transfiguration, and it sort of worked, because he did get the egg, but he got burned as well - the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the labrador; he only just got away. and that fleur girl tried this sort of charm, i think she was trying to put it into a trance - well, that kind of worked too, it went all sleepy, but then it snored, and this great jet of flame shot out, and her skirt caught fire - she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand.  and krum - you won't believe this, but he didn't even think of flying!  he was probably the best after you, though.  hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye.  only thing is, it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs - they took marks off for that, he wasn't supposed to do any damage to them.	1

19140	which they must practise like the men?	0
4573	well, we know what to get you next christmas, said hermione brightly.  then, when ron continued to look gloomy, she said, come on, ron, it could be worse.  at least your fingers aren't full of pus.  hermione was having a lot of difficulty managing her knife and fork, her fingers were so stiff and swollen.  i hate that skeeter woman!  she burst out savagely.  i'll get her back for this if it's the last thing i do!	1

12342	when we consider the question, without any fear of immediate application	0
1816	yeah, probably, said ron.  but dumbledore's always done things his way, hasn't he, and moody's been getting in trouble for years, i reckon.  attacks first and asks questions later - look at his dustbins.  balderdash.	1

2052	from their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds, they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water - except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all. some disturbance was taking place deep in the center; great bubbles were forming on the surface, waves were now washing over the muddy banks - and then, out in the very middle of the lake, a whirlpool appeared, as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake's floor. .	1

4316	harry said nothing.  he turned back to his ginger roots once more, picked up his knife, and started slicing them again.  he didn't like the sound of that truth potion at all, nor would he put it past snape to slip him some.  he repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if snape did it... quite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble - hermione and dobby for a start - there were all the other things he was concealing . . . like the fact that he was in contact with sirius . . . and - his insides squirmed at the thought - how he felt about cho. ... he tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too, and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of moody s book and start drinking only from a private hip flask.	1
15613	unjust, and the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away from	0
15844	that injustice is a man's own profit and interest, though injurious to	0
5567	at these words harry remembered, as though from a former life, the dueling club at hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago. ... all he had learned there was the disarming spell, expelliarmus. . . and what use would it be to deprive voldemort of his wand, even if he could, when he was surrounded by death eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one?  he had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this.  he knew he was facing the thing against which moody had always warned . . . the unblockable avada kedavra curse - and voldemort was right - his mother was not here to die for him this time. ... he was quite unprotected. . . .	1

8453	good. when relative terms have no attributes, their correlatives have	0
3582	harry definitely didn't want to listen to this; he knew hagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like this (he certainly would have) - if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly, but that wasn't really an option.  instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling along the stone reindeer's back, but the beetle just wasn't interesting enough to block out hagrid's next words.	1
14053	never be heeded (compare an exquisite passage, of which the conclusion	0
16663	yes, i replied; but that surely is what ought not to be, as the argument	0

6952	whose only wish is to understand the meaning of his opponents. at the	0
156	so - after many tantrums, after arguments that shook harry's bedroom floor, and many tears from aunt petunia - the new regime had begun.  the diet sheet that had been sent by the smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been emptied of all dudley's favorite things - fizzy drinks and cakes, chocolate bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that uncle vernon called rabbit food.  to make dudley feel better about it all, aunt petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too.  she now passed a grapefruit quarter to harry. he noticed that it was a lot smaller than dudley's.  aunt petunia seemed to feet that the best way to keep up dudley's morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get more to eat than harry.	1
1129	mr. weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep.  he used magic to pack up the tents, and they left the campsite as quickly as possible, passing mr. roberts at the door of his cottage.  mr. roberts had a strange, dazed look about him, and he waved them off with a vague merry christmas.	1

3413	don't get complacent, though. harry.  you've only done one task; whoever put you in for the tournament's got plenty more opportunity if they're trying to hurt you.  keep your eyes open -particularly when the person we discussed is around and concentrate on keeping yourself out of trouble.	1

3509	no, i don't like it, harry lied, and he led her away from the dance floor, past fred and angelina, who were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them were backing away in fear of injury, and over to the table where ron and padma were sitting.	1

14831	yes, polemarchus,--thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what was	0
12172	or country when seen at a distance only, the longing for an imaginary	0
7260	other point of view, would appear equally inconsistent. plato does not	0

436	next to mrs. weasley, fred, george, and charlie were all talking spiritedly about the world cup.	1
11320	under which they would have been included. we may therefore conceive god	0
2308	we must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the goblet of fire are bound to compete in the tournament.	1

4534	you'd better get up to the hospital wing, said harry as the owls around hermione took flight.  we'll tell professor sprout where you've gone. . . .	1
815	as one, the weasley boys and harry stuffed their fingers into their ears, but hermione, who hadn't bothered, was soon tugging on harry's arm.  he turned to look at her, and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears.	1
7619	nobler strain heard in the words:--'endure, my soul, thou hast endured	0

5634	harry felt himself slam flat into the ground; his face was pressed into grass; the smell of it filled his nostrils.  he had closed his eyes while the portkey transported him, and he kept them closed now.  he did not move.  all the breath seemed to have been knocked out of him; his head was swimming so badly he felt as though the ground beneath him were swaying like the deck of a ship.  to hold himself steady, he tightened his hold on the two things he was still clutching: the smooth, cold handle of the triwizard cup and cedric's body.  he felt as though he would slide away into the blackness gathering at the edges of his brain if he let go of either of them.  shock and exhaustion kept him on the ground, breathing in the smell of the grass, waiting . . . waiting for someone to do something . . . something to happen . . . and all the while, his scar burned dully on his forehead. . . .	1
3510	how's it going? harry asked ron, sitting down and opening a bottle of butterbeer.	1
6914	like--all which tends to show (1) that justice is the interest of the	0
3792	they left; many people were staring at them as they went.  harry glanced back as they reached the door.  rita skeeter's quick-quotes quill was out; it was zooming backward and forward over a piece of parchment on the table.	1
22842	predominantly seen,--the spirit of contention and ambition; and these	0
13664	(2) the republic is full of hope and aspiration: the laws bear the stamp	0
16532	magicians who transform themselves, neither do they deceive mankind in	0
6979	another question has not been answered: is the just or the unjust the	0
20154	of wisdom only, but of the whole?	0
3591	it is chilly, she said - but whatever the weather was doing, it was nowhere near as cold as her voice.  i think i will go in now.	1
22424	all these things, then, will have to be carefully considered by us; and	0
14415	transgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in his	0
4082	oh this is no use, hermione said, snapping shut weird wizarding dilemmas.  who on earth wants to make their nose hair grow into ringlets?	1
1328	 well, you can enchant a building so it's impossible to plot on a map, can't you?	1
19366	assigned to the women, who are the weaker natures, but in other respects	0
5957	dumbledore's voice carried no hint of a threat; it sounded like a mere statement, but fudge bristled as though dumbledore were advancing upon him with a wand.	1
5203	i'm aware of that, potter, she said.  the champions' families are invited to watch the final task, you know.  this is simply a chance for you to greet them.	1
6906	shepherd from the sheep. for you fancy that shepherds and rulers never	0

3722	ron said nothing.  he hadn't mentioned viktor krum since the ball, but harry had found a miniature arm under his bed on boxing day, which had looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing bulgarian quidditch robes.	1

5152	harry and ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory.  as harry pulled on his pajamas, he looked over at nevilles bed.  true to his word to dumbledore, he had not told ron and hermione about neville s parents.  as harry took off his glasses and climbed into his four-poster, he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you. he often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan, but as he listened to nevilles snores, he thought that neville deserved it more than he did.  lying in the darkness, harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured mr. and mrs. longbottom. ... he remembered the jeers of the crowd as crouch's son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the dementors. ... he understood how they had felt. . . . then he remembered the milk-white face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later. . . .	1

5207	harry finished his breakfast in the emptying great hall.  he saw fleur delacour get up from the ravenclaw table and join cedric as he crossed to the side chamber and entered.  krum slouched off to join them shortly afterward.  harry stayed where he was.  he really didn't want to go into the chamber.  he had no family - no family who would turn up to see him risk his life, anyway.  but just as he was getting up, thinking that he might as well go up to the library and do a spot more hex research, the door of the side chamber opened, and cedric stuck his head out.	1
11662	ways, shooting like stars to their birth. concerning his return to the	0
7975	which he saw around him. we are living upon the fragments of them, and	0
3187	 'course you can, said harry, and dobby beamed.	1
3763	er . . . nearly, said harry.	1
3913	pulling the cloak back over himself harry straightened up, listening hard with his eyes screwed up with fear. . . and, almost immediately -	1
11529	days afterwards his body was found untouched by corruption and sent home	0
20399	wisdom and not lovers of opinion.	0
3314	i'm really sorry, she said again.	1

25651	and according to the report of the messenger from the other world this	0
17836	i suppose that you mean houses, he replied.	0
19752	the olympic victor, i said, is deemed happy in receiving a part only of	0
9062	all. for if he will not yield to opinion, there follows the gentle	0
6508	'which is still worth asking,' because the investigation shows that we	0
19278	him?--would not these be the sort of differences which distinguish the	0
11288	book x. many things pleased me in the order of our state, but there	0
10756	ratio of 4:3; and this when combined with a figure of five gives two	0
24207	there can be no doubt of that, he replied.	0
17712	i understand, he said, the willing loss of a resolution; the meaning of	0
14349	life. some complain of the slights which are put upon them by relations,	0
23985	there can be no mistake, i said, as to which is which, and therefore	0
16140	him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by	0
7017	virtue is more than art. this is implied in the reductio ad absurdum	0
12175	human mind which are often felt among ourselves. such feelings meet with	0
6301	politics. even the fragments of his words when 'repeated at second-hand'	0
13038	contemplation of it. looking into the orb of light, he sees nothing, but	0
18372	the meaning is, i believe, that in the human soul there is a better and	0
7236	rewards and reputation, and points out the advantage which is given to	0
3760	what did he want? ron said, the moment harry had sat down.	1
1546	yeah, said fred airily, but that was years ago, wasn't it?  anyway, where's the fun without a bit of risk?  hey, ron, what if we find out how to get 'round dumbledore?  fancy entering?	1
3988	what is this thing?  said moody, drawing the marauder's map out of his pocket and unfolding it.	1
5725	at that moment, harry fully understood for the first time why people said dumbledore was the only wizard voldemort had ever feared.  the look upon dumbledore's face as he stared down at the unconscious form of mad-eye moody was more terrible than harry could have ever imagined.  there was no benign smile upon dumbledore's face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles.  there was cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of power radiated from dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heat.	1
2041	very well, said madame maxime, bowing slightly. will you please inform zis 'agrid zat ze 'orses drink only single-malt whiskey?	1
5649	he wanted me to bring him back, harry muttered - it seemed important to explain this.  he wanted me to bring him back to his parents. ...	1
5770	master barty, master barty, sobbed winky through her hands.  you isn't ought to tell them, we is getting in trouble. ...	1
16084	no objection. for i suspect that many will not be satisfied with the	0
17945	opponent is thinking of peasants at a festival, who are enjoying a life	0
19819	true, i said; but would you never allow them to run any risk?	0
5147	and fudge reckons madame maxime attacked crouch?  ron said, turning back to harry.	1
1958	cedric? said ron blankly as ernie hurried off.	1
7193	a philosophy is both foolish and false, like that opinion of the clever	0
10319	speaker,--fierce with slaves, but obedient to rulers, a lover of power	0
17892	miserable, and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness; the	0
24617	yes, he said, the purpose of the law is manifest.	0
16230	lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test	0
11752	a purgation of the passions by pity and fear; to him they appear only to	0

21603	the sun himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated? when he	0

11545	their sorrows, but the spirits from above spoke of glorious sights and	0
24429	and must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element	0
15944	and how will they proceed? will each bring the result of his labours	0
18021	poor, the other of the rich; these are at war with one another; and in	0
4361	let me get this straight, he said after a while, brandishing a fresh chicken leg. you first saw the elfin the top box. she was saving crouch a seat, right?	1
3299	he found it hard to concentrate on snape's potions test, and consequently forgot to add the key ingredient - a bezoar - meaning that he received bottom marks.  he didn't care, though; he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do.  when the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and hurried to the dungeon door.	1
11925	characterize the greater part of the world. for we too have reason to	0
4761	okay. . . hows this for a theory, said ron excitedly.  krum attacked crouch - no, wait for it - and then stunned himself!	1
19942	the arms of hellenes, if we care to maintain good feeling with other	0
24306	but that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion,	0
14221	the abnegation of it: the one, limited by experience, the other,	0
20695	and what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare	0
3171	oh you is a bad elf, dobby!  moaned winky, tears leaking down her face once more.  my poor mr. crouch, what is he doing without winky?  he is needing me, he is needing my help!  i is looking after the crouches all my life, and my mother is doing it before me, and my grandmother is doing it before her ... oh what is they saying if they knew winky was freed?  oh the shame, the shame!  she buried her face in her skirt again and bawled.	1
23745	why, you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence? what!	0
25025	and that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of	0
22828	and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment of them;	0

4749	they marched in silence past the beauxbatons carriage and up toward the castle.	1
12315	the land in common and divided the produce, and there were others who	0
4640	but something moved behind krum in the trees, and harry, who had some experience of the sort of thing that lurked in the forest, instinctively grabbed krum's arm and pulled him around.	1
6066	the ministry of magic, dumbledore continued, does not wish me to tell you this.  it is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that i have done so - either because they will not believe that lord voldemort has returned, or because they think i should not tell you so, young as you are.  it is my belief, however, that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to pretend that cedric died as the result of an accident, or some sort of blunder of his own, is an insult to his memory.	1
17857	and not only their education, but their habitations, and all that	0
4036	what? said ron, his eyes widening, his next cushion spinning high into the air, ricocheting off the chandelier, and dropping heavily onto flitwick's desk.  harry... maybe moody thinks snape put your name in the goblet of fire!	1
9179	that our laws are not only the best, but that they are also possible,	0
22224	that of the astronomers, is in vain.	0
3866	harry took a great breath and slid under the surface - and now, sitting on the marble bottom of the bubble-filled bath, he heard a chorus of eerie voices singing to him from the open egg in his hands:	1
13283	disbelief in medicine has led in this, as in some other departments of	0
10989	either masters or servants,--the joys of friendship are unknown to them.	0
22666	also the happiest, and the worst the most miserable. i asked you	0
19402	me feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of	0
2874	concentrate, harry, concentrate. . . .	1
22259	but do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason	0
7873	within. there let them sacrifice and set up their tents; for soldiers	0
15888	from a distance; and it occurred to some one else that they might be	0
15701	to whom the black earth brings forth wheat and barley, whose trees are	0
562	you're not the first one who's had trouble with money, said mr. roberts, scrutinizing mr. weasley closely. i had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago.	1
11894	third generation, they have had mosques, temples, churches, monasteries.	0
23674	what a blessed alternative, i said:--to be compelled to dwell only with	0
12028	planets, and they move in orbits without them, although in an opposite	0
11591	from time to time guiding the outer circle with a touch of her right	0
18625	that is the correct mode of describing them, he replied.	0
24918	and judge only from his words, imagine that if he speaks of cobbling,	0
9519	self-evidencing knowledge of the whole the faculty of mind is supposed	0
12411	the common interest with an intelligence and persistency which mankind	0
17669	yes, he will be absolutely necessary.	0
6020	harry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table.	1
9381	and philanthrope by turns; or in a few instances, like the founders	0
5040	no!  mother, no!  i didn't do it, i didn't do it, i didn't know!  don't send me there, don't let him!	1
22006	effect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and	0
4512	it was an irritable sort of day after that.  harry got so tired of ron and hermione sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that he took sirius's food up to the owlery that evening on his own.	1
780	the great shamrock dissolved, the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela, and settled themselves cross-legged to watch the match.	1
14122	a worship of god in trinity, that is of wisdom, love and power,	0
21304	aye, i said, i knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you would	0
12732	or suppressed. what a condition of man would that be, in which human	0
3619	it was cedric diggory.  harry could see cho waiting for him in the entrance hall below.	1
21049	him in this new light, they will surely change their notion of him, and	0
5670	the dark lord got his body back?  he's returned?	1
10437	unnecessary pleasures are those which do no good, and of which the	0
22830	spend large sums on their wives, or on any others whom they please.	0
4844	we helped, ron said quickly.  me and hermione helped.	1
22288	i agree in what you are saying, he replied, which may be hard to	0
20837	not dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of vain pomp and senseless	0
5315	i don't know, said harry slowly.	1
16082	the true and healthy constitution of the state is the one which i have	0
3254	hermione looked severely over at him too.  i'd have thought you'd be doing something constructive, harry, even if you don't want to learn your antidotes!	1
52	without harry potter? breathed the second voice softly.  i see...	1
23253	see too, i said, the forgiving spirit of democracy, and the 'don't	0
7229	which was not equally present to his mind.	0
21118	but again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable	0
2931	very daring!  bagman was yelling, and harry heard the chinese fireball emit a horrible, roaring shriek, while the crowd drew its collective breath.  that's some nerve he's showing - and - yes, he's got the egg!	1
2725	the dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward to their fallen charges, each of which was the size of a small hill.  they hurried to tighten the chains and fasten them securely to iron pegs, which they forced deep into the ground with their wands.	1
4182	there were rocks littering the lake bottom.  he dived and snatched up a particularly jagged one and returned to the statue.  he began to hack at the ropes binding ron, and after several minutes' hard work, they broke apart.  ron floated, unconscious, a few inches above the lake bottom, drifting a little in the ebb of the water.	1
23259	grandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet,	0
2600	harry could remember too.  he could remember it as though it had happened yesterday....	1
14381	poor man old age cannot be a light burden, nor can a bad rich man ever	0
10612	noticeable qualities. he is described as ill educated, but, like the	0
2275	viktor krum, cedric diggory, and fleur delacour were grouped around the fire.  they looked strangely impressive, silhouetted against the flames. krum, hunched-up and brooding, was leaning against the mantelpiece, slightly apart from the other two.  cedric was standing with his hands behind his back, staring into the fire.  fleur delacour looked around when harry walked in and threw back her sheet of long, silvery hair.	1
6214	the state are more clearly drawn out in the laws; as works of art, the	0
1013	here, look. mr. diggory held up a wand and showed it to mr. weasley. had it in her hand. so that's clause three of the code of wand use broken, for a start. no non-human creature is permitted to carry or use a wand.	1

3764	well, i don't think dumbledore would like it if he knew bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat!  said hermione, still looking deeply disapproving.  i hope he's trying to help cedric as much!	1

2467	meanwhile there was no reply from sirius, hedwig was refusing to come anywhere near him, professor trelawney was predicting his death with even more certainty than usual, and he did so badly at summoning charms in professor flitwick's class that he was given extra homework - the only person to get any, apart from neville.	1

20877	creatures who, seeing this land open to them--a land well stocked with	0
1512	the stranger reached dumbledore.  he stretched out a hand that was as badly scarred as his face, and dumbhedore shook it, muttering words harry couldn't hear.  he seemed to be making some inquiry of the stranger, who shook his head unsmilingly and replied in an undertone.  dumbledore nodded and gestured the man to the empty seat on his right-hand side.	1

4157	light green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see, two feet deep, like a meadow of very overgrown grass.  harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him, trying to discern shapes through the gloom . . . and then, without warning, something grabbed hold of his ankle.	1

4178	he looked around.  many of the merpeople surrounding them were carrying spears.  he swam swiftly toward a seven-foot-tall merman with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to mime a request to borrow the spear.  the merman laughed and shook his head.	1
3149	that's not very much! hermione shouted indignantly from the floor, over winky's continued screaming and fist-beating.	1
17726	this i call theft. now you understand me?	0
363	mr. weasley hesitated.  harry could tell that, however angry he was with fred and george, he hadn't really intended to tell mrs. weasley what had happened.  there was a silence, while mr. weasley eyed his wife nervously.  then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind mrs. weasley.  one, with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth, was harry's and ron's friend, hermione granger.  the other, who was small and red-haired, was ron's younger sister, ginny. both of them smiled at harry, who grinned back, which made ginny go scarlet - she had been very taken with harry ever since his first visit to the burrow.	1

5293	he met nothing for ten minutes, but kept running into dead ends.  twice he took the same wrong turning.  finally, he found a new route and started to jog along it, his wandlight waving, making his shadow flicker and distort on the hedge walls.  then he rounded another corner and found himself facing a blast-ended skrewt.	1

2123	mr. bagman and mr. crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the triwizard tournament, dumbledore continued, and they will be joining myself, professor karkaroff, and madame maxime on the panel that will judge the champions' efforts.	1
1663	harry spun around. professor moody was limping down the marble staircase.  his wand was out and it was pointing right at a pure white ferret, which was shivering on the stone-flagged floor, exactly where malfoy had been standing.	1
4604	they walked down the dark lawn to the quidditch stadium, turned through a gap in the stands, and walked out onto the field.	1

586	harry bent down, ducked under the tent flap, and felt his jaw drop.  he had walked into what looked like an old-fashioned, three room flat, complete with bathroom and kitchen. oddly enough, it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as mrs. figg's house:  there were crocheted covers on the mismatched chairs and a strong smell of cats.	1

3727	it was indeed odd. harry thought, that bagman was here at the three broomsticks on a weekend when there was no triwizard event, and therefore no judging to be done.  he watched bagman in the mirror.  he was looking strained again, quite as strained as he had that night in the forest before the dark mark had appeared.  but just then bagman glanced over at the bar, saw harry, and stood up.	1
5629	stand aside!  i will kill him!  he is mine! shrieked voldemort.  harry's hand had closed on cedric's wrist; one tombstone stood between him and voldemort, but cedric was too heavy to carry, and the cup was out of reach -	1
10740	but such a deception as this is inconsistent with the manner in which	0
12050	forming a whole, partly arises out of the attempt to connect the motions	0

941	honestly! said hermione, and she and harry grabbed ron firmly by the arms, wheeled him around, and marched him away. by the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely, they were in the very heart of the wood.  they seemed to be alone now; everything was much quieter.	1

2239	at long last, the golden plates returned to their original spotless state; there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the hall, which died away almost instantly as dumbledore got to his feet.  on either side of him, professor karkaroff and madame maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone.  ludo bagman was beaming and winking at various students. mr. crouch, however, looked quite uninterested, almost bored.	1

2925	one down, three to go!  bagman yelled as the whistle blew again.  miss delacour, if you please!	1
769	and as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started chasing through harry's dazed mind.  he wanted to do something very impressive, right now.  jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea. . . but would it be good enough?	1

6016	when he looked back, even a month later, harry found he had only scattered memories of the next few days.  it was as though he had been through too much to take in any more.  the recollections he did have were very painful.  the worst, perhaps, was the meeting with the diggorys that took place the following morning.	1
10965	'i can only say, that i should not much like to be in their place.'	0
5735	if either snape or mcgonagall found these instructions peculiar, they hid their confusion. both turned at once and left the office.  dumbledore walked over to the trunk with seven locks, fitted the first key in the lock, and opened it.  it contained a mass of spell-books.  dumbledore closed the trunk, placed a second key in the second lock, and opened the trunk again.  the spellbooks had vanished; this time it contained an assortment of broken sneako-scopes, some parchment and quills, and what looked like a silvery invisibility cloak.  harry watched, astounded, as dumbledore placed the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth keys in their respective locks, reopening the trunk each time, and revealing different contents each time.  then he placed the seventh key in the lock, threw open the lid, and harry let out a cry of amazement.	1
15696	   'to bear acorns at their summit, and bees in the middle;	0

112	harry ran his fingers over the scar again.  it was still painful.  he turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the room, opened his wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door.  a skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair.  he examined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely.  it looked normal, but it was still stinging.	1

444	ron looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy talking, then he said very quietly to harry, so - have you heard from sirius lately?	1

23212	they? for as the government is, such will be the man.	0
1900	early next morning, harry woke with a plan fully formed in his mind, as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all night.  he got up, dressed in the pale dawn light, left the dormitory without waking ron, and went back down to the deserted common room.  here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon which his divination homework still lay and wrote the following letter:	1
3451	animal magnetism, said ron gloomily, pulling stray threads out of his cuffs.	1
3373	wait here, he said to ron, and he stood up, walked straight up to parvati, and said, parvati? will you go to the ball with me?	1

1102	what? said bill, charlie, and percy together. harry's wand? said fred.	1
2800	 they walked three times around the lake, trying all the way to think of a simple spell that would subdue a dragon.  nothing whatsoever occurred to them, so they retired to the library instead.  here, harry pulled down every book he could find on dragons, and both of them set to work searching through the large pile.	1

4944	where was this place?  it surely wasn't hogwarts; he had never seen a room like that here in the castle.  moreover, the crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom of the basin was comprised of adults, and harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at hogwarts. they seemed, he thought, to be waiting for something; even though he could only see the tops of their hats, all of their faces seemed to be pointing in one direction, and none of them were talking to one another.	1
13380	conception of knowledge, for example the scholastic philosophy, may lead	0
5132	yes, professor, said harry, turning to go.	1

709	clutching their purchases, mr. weasley in the lead, they all hurried into the wood, following the lantern-lit trail.  they could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them, shouts and laughter, snatches of singing.  the atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious; harry couldn't stop grinning.  they walked through the wood for twenty minutes, talking and joking loudly, until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium.  though harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field, he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it.	1

22342	but let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the subjects	0

19090	men who love him need occasion no fear or faltering in his mind; but to	0
3470	parvati was gazing at hermione in unflattering disbelief.  she wasn't the only one either; when the doors to the great hall opened, krum's fan club from the library stalked past, throwing hermione looks of deepest loathing.  pansy parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with malfoy, and even he didn't seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her.  ron, however, walked right past hermione without looking at her.	1

3842	it was awkward moving under the cloak tonight, because harry had the heavy egg under one arm and the map held in front of his nose with the other. however, the moonlit corridors were empty and silent, and by checking the map at strategic intervals, harry was able to ensure that he wouldn't run into anyone he wanted to avoid.  when he reached the statue of boris the bewildered, a lost-looking wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands, he located the right door, leaned close to it, and muttered the password, pine fresh, just as cedric had told him.	1

5781	i wanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master.  my father had left the tent; he had gone to free the muggles.  winky was afraid to see me so angry.  she used her own brand of magic to bind me to her.  she pulled me from the tent, pulled me into the forest, away from the death eaters.  i tried to hold her back.  i wanted to return to the campsite.  i wanted to show those death eaters what loyalty to the dark lord meant, and to punish them for their lack of it.  i used the stolen wand to cast the dark mark into the sky.	1

21226	yes, he said, i thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair	0

8283	to have gathered from the teaching of anaxagoras. they recognise that	0

25184	that you should take him up again and again and get to know him and	0

25947	1.f.6.  indemnity - you agree to indemnify and hold the foundation, the	0
2649	wronski feint, said harry, through gritted teeth.  quite apart from liking to get quidditch terms correct, it caused him another pang to imagine ron's expression if he could have heard hermione talking about wonky-faints.	1
7679	when one of these polyphonous pantomimic gentlemen offers to exhibit	0
3634	next time there's a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!	1
8362	well then, offer up a prayer and follow. the way is dark and difficult;	0

168	harry would have dearly loved to have said, so what? but he didn't feel that uncle vernon's temper should be tested this early in the morning, especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food.  he therefore settled for looking politely puzzled.	1
4885	wormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve in his body were on fire, the screaming filled harry's ears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain; he was yelling too...voldemort would hear him, would know he was there. . . .	1
11946	and feelings of love might still be the incentive to great thoughts	0
10109	pythagoreans, whom he proposes to consult as in the previous discussion	0
6361	in this life, which has now been assured, is crowned by the vision of	0
548	a man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents.  harry knew at a glance that this was the only real muggle for several acres.  when he heard their footsteps, he turned his head to look at them.	1
5732	this is not alastor moody, said dumbledore quietly.  you have never known alastor moody.  the real moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight.  the moment he took you, i knew - and i followed.	1

187	uncle vernon was still glaring at harry, who tried to keep his expression neutral.  if he didn't do or say anything stupid, he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime.  he waited for uncle vernon to say something, but he merely continued to glare.  harry decided to break the silence.	1

14707	that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer, and try irony or	0

13446	heroes, at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other.	0
5193	an odd, dreamy expression suddenly came over hermione's face.  she slowly raised a hand and ran her fingers through her hair.	1

14826	nothing can be clearer, socrates, said polemarchus.	0
19363	then let the wives of our guardians strip, for their virtue will be	0
14866	indeed, thrasymachus, and do i really appear to you to argue like an	0

4887	harry opened his eyes.  he was lying on the floor of professor trelawney's room with his hands over his face.  his scar was still burning so badly that his eyes were watering.  the pain had been real.  the whole class was standing around him, and ron was kneeling next to him, looking terrified.	1

4591	hermione, however, did not ask harry and ron to help her pursue vengeance against rita skeeter, for which they were both grateful, because their workload was mounting ever higher in the days before the easter holidays.  harry frankly marveled at the fact that hermione could research magical methods of eavesdropping as well as everything else they had to do.  he was working flat-out just to get through all their homework, though he made a point of sending regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain for sirius; after last summer, harry had not forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry.  he enclosed notes to sirius, telling him that nothing out of the ordinary had happened, and that they were still waiting for an answer from percy.	1

2146	professor karkaroff spun around. mad-eye moody was standing there, leaning heavily on his staff, his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the durmstrang headmaster.	1

5742	then, before harry's very eyes, the face of the man on the floor began to change.  the scars were disappearing, the skin was becoming smooth; the mangled nose became whole and started to shrink.  the long mane of grizzled gray hair was withdrawing into the scalp and turning the color of straw.  suddenly, with a loud clunk, the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place; next moment, the magical eyeball had popped out of the man's face as a real eye replaced it; it rolled away across the floor and continued to swivel in every direction.	1

2851	he let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the large trunk under the window.  it had seven keyholes in a row.  harry wondered what was in there, until moody's next question brought him sharply back to earth.	1

4873	she waved her wand and the lamps went out.  the fire was the only source of light now.  professor trelawney bent down and lifted, from under her chair, a miniature model of the solar system, contained within a glass dome.  it was a beautiful thing; each of the moons glimmered in place around the nine planets and the fiery sun, all of them hanging in thin air beneath the glass.  harry watched lazily as professor trelawney began to point out the fascinating angle mars was making to neptune.  the heavily perfumed fumes washed over him, and the breeze from the window played across his face.  he could hear an insect humming gently somewhere behind the curtain.  his eyelids began to droop. . . .	1

23844	and is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?	0
6889	of course this was not the original assertion, nor is the new	0
903	where're your parents? said harry, his temper rising. out there wearing masks, are they?	1
8656	the exposure is better than the concealment of the person, and now they	0
5016	but there was an angry outcry from the surrounding benches.  several of the witches and wizards around the walls stood up, shaking their heads, and even their fists, at mr. crouch.	1

287	harry retreated to the sofa.  uncle vernon, however, moved forward.	1
11460	'and can we conceive things greater still?' not, perhaps, in this brief	0
2338	he moved forward into the firelight.  close up, harry thought he looked ill.  there were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin, papery look about his wrinkled skin that had not been there at the quidditch world cup.	1
4223	well - said harry. he would have told her about dobby, but he had just noticed karkaroff watching him.  he was the only judge who had not left the table; the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that harry, ron, and fleur's sister had got back safely. yeah, that's right, said harry, raising his voice slightly so that karkaroff could hear him.	1

3747	harry stared up into bagman's round, rosy face and his wide, baby-blue eyes.	1
896	what's that supposed to mean? said hermione defiantly.  granger, they're after muggles, said malfoy.  d'you want to be showing off your knickers in midair?  because if you do, hang around. . . they're moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.	1

4309	i don't know what you're talking about, harry lied coldly.	1
11112	those who feast only on earthly food, are always going at random up	0
16489	highest part of himself, or about the truest and highest matters; there,	0
13031	of the science? he refuses to answer, as if intending by the refusal to	0
24506	yes, he said, human life is certainly concerned with them.	0

1910	so what? said harry. he's not going back to azkaban because of me.	1
14863	is for his own interest; and the subject is required to execute his	0
23938	assisted by the infatuation of the people, they choose from among	0
8069	there seems to mingle in plato a sort of pythagorean reverence for	0
21784	the toils of state, when they are allowed to spend the greater part of	0
24575	money, especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men,	0
9789	to eternal existence. the geometer is always talking of squaring,	0
20491	then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all	0
4229	look after gabrielle, she told her, and then she turned to harry.  you saved 'er, she said breathlessly.  even though she was not your 'ostage.	1
7624	in taking gifts from agamemnon; or his requiring a ransom for the body	0
19417	the measure; and hereafter the question of possibility.	0
3868	we cannot sing above the ground,	1
2677	what wouldn't he have given to be one of these peophe, sitting around laughing and talking, with nothing to worry about but homework?  he imagined how it would have felt to be here if his name hadn't come out of the goblet of fire.  he wouldn't be wearing the invisibility cloak, for one thing.  ron would be sitting with him.  the three of them would probably be happily imagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing on tuesday.  he'd have been really hooking forward to it, watching them do whatever it was...cheering on cedric with everyone else, safe in a seat at the back of the stands...	1
2985	ron drew breath as he and harry reached the edge of the enclosure.  now that the horntail had been taken away, harry could see where the five judges were sitting - right at the other end, in raised seats draped in gold.	1
12343	to practice, in the spirit of plato's republic, are we quite sure that	0
22012	fractions; or (2) that division is regarded by them as a process of	0

5161	harry and hermione went to see. malfoy, crabbe, and goyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below.  crabbe and goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout; both were smirking.  malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it.	1
11826	element of good giving power to evil, tyranny, even for a short time,	0
20761	no, indeed, i said, even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly;	0
2330	alastor!  said dumbledore warningly.  harry wondered for a moment whom he was speaking to, but then realized mad-eye could hardly be moody's real first name.  moody fell silent, though still surveying karkaroff with satisfaction - karkaroff's face was burning.	1
21110	little calmer at what they have just heard?	0
14012	states that are well and wisely governed,' are curiously at variance	0
17007	narrative; but there will be very little of the former, and a great deal	0
13698	children, the community of property, and the constitution of the state.	0
4247	fleur was clapping very hard too, but krum didn't look happy at all.  he attempted to engage hermione in conversation again, but she was too busy cheering harry to listen.	1
9012	i shall answer you in a parable which will also let you see how poor a	0
18229	and whichever of these qualities we find in the state, the one which is	0
24208	since, then, the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in	0
10859	3. in other words, the whole expression will be: (1), for the first	0
11988	republic, as elsewhere, he wavers between the original soul which has	0
6225	thinkers ever attained. plato among the greeks, like bacon among the	0
5655	dumbledore, amos diggorys running . . . he's coming over. . . . don't you think you should tell him - before he sees - ?	1
24504	life, if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months and	0
16403	tragedy in which these iambic verses occur--or of the house of pelops,	0
8425	first he must prove that there are three parts of the individual soul.	0
11832	the old spirit of freedom is roused within him at their prostitution of	0
9207	heard me speak of the idea of good, about which we know so little, and	0
13993	world, not in bigness, but in virtue and power. him they call the father	0
21186	cleverness, and similar qualities, do not often grow together, and that	0
19547	age who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without	0
1258	arthur, you know mad-eye, said mr. diggory's head, rolling its eyes again. someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night?  more likely there's a very shell-shocked cat wandering around somewhere, covered in potato peelings.  but if the improper use of magic lot get their hands on mad-eye, he's had it -- think of his record -- we've got to get him off on a minor charge, something in your department -- what are exploding dustbins worth?	1
13433	in the platonic dialectic; all metaphysicians have something in common	0
14884	why, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you failed.	0
22088	i am strongly inclined to it, he said; the observation of the seasons	0
22149	and what then would you say?	0
16199	i am afraid that what you say is true, he replied.	0
5333	next, tell me what's always the last thing to mend,	1
12102	morgenstern: (a) the community of property; (b) of families; (c) the	0
450	well, i certainly don't, said percy sanctimoniously.  i shudder to think what the state of my in-tray would be if i was away from work for five days.	1
7197	(although capable also of perversion), any more than they describe the	0
20873	who affirm of her votaries that some are good for nothing, and that the	0
8115	not recognize that time is the great healer both of mental and bodily	0
3761	he offered to help me with the golden egg, said harry.	1
8356	and attuning the upper and middle and lower classes like the strings of	0
6498	been raised by boeckh, respecting the imaginary date at which the	0
139	harry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat down at his desk; he pulled a piece of parchment toward him, loaded his eagle-feather quill with ink, wrote dear sirius, then paused, wondering how best to phrase his problem, still marveling at the fact that he hadn't thought of sirius straight away.  but then, perhaps it wasn't so surprising - after all, he had only found out that sirius was his godfather two months ago.	1
17755	all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature, such as will be	0
10222	falsehood, the apology which socrates makes for his earnestness of	0
16717	and of the words which follow? would you say that these, or any similar	0
16846	chryses, failing of his object, invoked the anger of the god against the	0
10514	sort speak and act, while the others buzz about the bema and prevent	0
2170	the decorations in the great hall had changed this morning. as it was halloween, a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling, while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner.  harry led the way over to dean and seamus, who were discussing those hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering.	1
20921	holds his peace, and goes his own way. he is like one who, in the storm	0
5846	his eyes gazed into harry's and it was almost as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between them.	1
16033	and there is another class of servants, who are intellectually hardly	0
12162	the character of the individual timocrat is borrowed from the spartan	0
19330	secondly whether they were the most beneficial?	0
24480	and if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an	0
9727	it is not the turning over of an oyster-shell, but the conversion of a	0
7981	is at any rate remarkable that the greatest perfection of the fine arts	0

18064	marriage, the possession of women and the procreation of children, which	0
19765	consider this question, but that, as at present advised, we would make	0
21025	providentially compelled, whether they will or not, to take care of the	0
2191	the students from beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the grounds, among them, the veela-girl.  those gathered around the goblet of fire stood back to let them pass, watching eagerly.	1
12720	sufficient answer, if any is needed. the difference about them and us is	0
12528	exalting to heaven, nor yet abusing the natural instincts. all that	0
6321	and 'kings are philosophers' and 'philosophers are kings;' and there	0
477	but bill and charlie and percy can all do it?	1
13329	than in any previous age the necessity has been recognized of restoring	0
21555	see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which	0
18631	objections, and prove at length that they are untrue, let us assume	0
13750	of innocence which is described in the myth, or a state like our own	0
22925	power and the poor man is deprived of it.	0
2519	yeah, really amazing, said harry heavily as they set off toward the steps into the entrance hall.  what do they want photos for, colin?	1
21712	bodily qualities, for even when they are not originally innate they can	0
25628	peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will make	0
324	they didn't say anything at all.  harry moved toward the fire, but just as he reached the edge of the hearth, mr. weasley put out a hand and held him back.  he was looking at the dursleys in amazement.	1
17058	to exhibit himself and his poetry, we will fall down and worship him as	0
5932	listen to me, cornelius, said dumbledore, taking a step toward fudge, and once again, he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that harry had felt after dumbledore had stunned young crouch.  harry is as sane as you or i.  that scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains.  i believe it hurts him when lord voldemort is close by, or feeling particularly murderous.	1
2143	karkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors, reaching them at exactly the same moment as harry, ron, and hermione.  harry stopped to let him walk through first.	1
15766	are unmistakeable. but if, though unjust, i acquire the reputation of	0
15720	is found in prose writers. the universal voice of mankind is always	0
16644	still more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce	0
6881	ruler or stronger makes a mistake--then the interest of the stronger is	0
23571	and then, although they may have no desire of change, the others charge	0

2997	you're tied in first place, harry!  you and krum!  said charlie weasley, hurrying to meet them as they set off back toward the school.  listen, i've got to run, i've got to go and send mum an owl, i swore i'd tell her what happened - but that was unbelievable!  oh yeah - and they told me to tell you you've got to hang around for a few more minutes.. . . bagman wants a word, back in the champions' tent.	1

20065	the truth? what do you say?	0
1389	er - yeah, all right, said harry.  he turned back to hermione, ron, and nearly headless nick.  brothers and sisters usually go in the same houses, don't they?  he said.  he was judging by the weasleys, all seven of whom had been put into gryffindor.	1
3	the little hagletons all agreed that the old house was creepy.  half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce.  the story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore.  every version of the tale, however, started in the same place:  fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer's morning when the riddle house had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three riddles dead.	1

6168	the rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; harry wished it could have gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never arrive at king's cross . . . but as he had learned the hard way that year, time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead, and all too soon, the hogwarts express was pulling in at platform nine and three-quarters.  the usual confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark.  ron and hermione struggled out past malfoy, crabbe, and goyle, carrying their trunks.  harry, however, stayed put.	1
5628	from a muffled yell, he thought he had stopped at least one of them, but there was no time to stop and look; he jumped over the cup and dived as he heard more wand blasts behind him; more jets of light flew over his head as he fell, stretching out his hand to grab cedric's arm...	1

890	tripped over a tree root, he said angrily, getting to his feet again.	1
3200	professor mcgonagall's irritated voice cracked like a whip through the transfiguration class on thursday, and harry and ron both jumped and looked up.	1
2894	now, don't panic, she said, just keep a cool head. . . . we've got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of hand. . . . the main thing is just to do your best, and nobody will think any the worse of you. . . . are you all right?	1

23368	there is a battle and they gain the day, and then modesty, which	0
3062	rita acted as though she hadn't heard what hagrid had said.	1
851	he was very brave, wasn't he?  hermione said, leaning forward to watch krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling leprechauns and veela to get to him.  he looks a terrible mess. . .	1
10931	but when a man's pulse beats temperately; and he has supped on a feast	0

2503	harry's ears were ringing.  the injustice of it made him want to curse snape into a thousand slimy pieces.  he passed snape, walked with ron to the back of the dungeon, and slammed his bag down onto the table.  ron was shaking with anger too - for a moment, it felt as though everything was back to normal between them, but then ron turned and sat down with dean and seamus instead, leaving harry alone at his table.  on the other side of the dungeon, malfoy turned his back on snape and pressed his badge, smirking. potter stinks flashed once more across the room.	1
15674	brother, interposed: socrates, he said, you do not suppose that there is	0

611	he looks really grumpy, said hermione, looking around at the many krums blinking and scowling at them.	1
4448	sirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall.  buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky floor, looking for bones he might have overlooked.  finally, sirius looked up at ron.	1
21306	true, socrates; but i must say that one who like you has passed a	0
20080	change were made, which is not a slight or easy though still a possible	0
17970	but, on the other hand, if he has no money, and cannot provide himself	0
10220	which recognizes and combines first principles. the contempt which	0
24939	hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the	0

21436	visibility in all visible things, but of generation and nourishment and	0
453	it was, fred whispered to harry as they got up from the table.  we sent it.	1
2775	yeah, but. . . it's not very likely she'd have walked straight into voldemort, is it? said harry.	1

19905	yes; and we accept his authority.	0
820	and unless i'm much mistaken, mostafa is actually attempting to send off the bulgarian team mascots!  said bagman's voice.  now there's something we haven't seen before. . . . oh this could turn nasty. . .	1
3146	and then dobby had the idea. harry potter, sir! 'why doesn't dobby and winky find work together?'  dobby says.  'where is there enough work for two house-elves?' says winky. and dobby thinks, and it comes to him, sir!  hogwarts!  so dobby and winky came to see professor dumbledore, sir, and professor dumbledore took us on!	1
126	harry had been a year old the night that voldemort -- the most powerful dark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years -- arrived at his house and killed his father and mother.  voldemort had then turned his wand on harry; he had performed the curse that had disposed of many full-grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power -- and, incredibly, it had not worked.  instead of killing the small boy, the curse had rebounded upon voldemort.  harry had survived with nothing but a lightning-shaped cut on his forehead, and voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive.  his powers gone, his life almost extinguished, voldemort had fled; the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted, voldemort's followers had disbanded, and harry potter had become famous.	1
5962	there, said snape harshly.  there.  the dark mark.  it is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago, when it burned black, but you can still see it.  every death eater had the sign burned into him by the dark lord.  it was a means of distinguishing one another, and his means of summoning us to him.  when he touched the mark of any death eater, we were to disapparate, and apparate, instantly, at his side.  this mark has been growing clearer all year. karkaroff s too.  why do you think karkaroff fled tonight?  we both felt the mark burn.  we both knew he had returned.  karkaroff fears the dark lord's vengeance.  he betrayed too many of his fellow death eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold.	1
4981	there was antonin dolohov, he said.  i - i saw him torture countless muggles and - and non-supporters of the dark lord.	1
22536	and then arguments many and diverse refute his words, until he is driven	0
25820	whenever any copy of a project gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the	0

768	the veela had started to dance, and harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank.  all that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen.	1

5062	dumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip into his own silvery hair, near his temple.  when he took the wand away, hair seemed to be clinging to it - but then harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange silvery-white substance that filled the pensieve.  dumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin, and harry, astonished, saw his own face swimming around the surface of the bowl.  dumbledore placed his long hands on either side of the pensieve and swirled it, rather as a gold prospector would pan for fragments of gold.... and harry saw his own face change smoothly into snape's, who opened his mouth and spoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly.	1

3058	hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering harry and ron and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of its end, withering the pumpkin plants nearby.	1
2809	and sure enough, as they left the library, a gang of girls tiptoed past them, one of them wearing a bulgaria scarf tied around her waist.	1
6070	harry potter managed to escape lord voldemort, said dumbledore.  he risked his own life to return cedric's body to hogwarts.  he showed, in every respect, the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing lord voldemort, and for this, i honor him.	1

1626	saturn, dear, the planet saturn!  said professor trelawney, sounding definitely irritated that he wasn't riveted by this news.  i was saying that saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your birth. . . . your dark hair. . . your mean stature...tragic losses so young in life. . . i think i am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in midwinter?	1

11295	i love the man, i love truth more, and therefore i must speak out: and	0
24773	them which both of them would have for their idea, and that would be the	0

5317	no, said harry.  i reckon we should send up red sparks.  someone'll come and collect him . . . otherwise he'll probably be eaten by a skrewt.	1
23872	and especially by love himself, who is in a manner the captain of them,	0
22300	absolute truth, according to my notion. whether what i told you would	0
22253	i suspect so; but you are speaking, socrates, of a vast work.	0

3091	but hermione wasn't at dinner, nor was she in the library when they went to look for her afterward.  the only person in there was viktor krum.  ron hovered behind the bookshelves for a while, watching krum, debating in whispers with harry whether he should ask for an autograph - but then ron realized that six or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books, debating exactly the same thing, and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea.	1
18277	the smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous.	0
2512	sir - sir, mr. bagman wants him, he said nervously.  all the champions have got to go, i think they want to take photographs. . .	1
7853	then to the soldiers, lastly to the people. we will inform them that	0

5585	you won't? said voldemort quietly, and the death eaters were not laughing now. you won't say no?  harry, obedience is a virtue i need to teach you before you die. . . . perhaps another little dose of pain?	1
4272	of his parents, fourteen-year-old harry potter thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at hogwarts, muggle-born hermione granger.  little did he know that he would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow in a life already littered with personal loss.	1
5237	mum - bill! said ron, looking stunned, as he joined the gryffindor table.  what're you doing here?	1
1513	the stranger sat down, shook his mane of dark gray hair out of his face, pulled a plate of sausages toward him, raised it to what was left of his nose, and sniffed it. he then took a small knife out of his pocket, speared a sausage on the end of it, and began to eat.  his normal eye was fixed upon the sausages, but the blue eye was still darting restlessly around in its socket, taking in the hall and the students.	1

19259	next, we shall ask our opponent how, in reference to any of the pursuits	0
12838	still, while condemning plato, we must acknowledge that neither	0
5916	as minerva and severus have doubtless told you, said dumbledore, we heard barty crouch confess.  under the influence of veritaserum, he told us how he was smuggled out of azkaban, and how voldemort - learning of his continued existence from bertha jorkins - went to free him from his father and used him to capture harry.  the plan worked, i tell you.  crouch has helped voldemort to return.	1
17443	i mean this: when a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough	0
8765	called saviours and allies; and the subjects who in other states are	0
20321	then you would infer that opinion is intermediate?	0

583	harry had never been camping in his life; the dursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday, preferring to leave him with mrs. figg, an old neighbor.  however, he and hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs should go, and though mr. weasley was more of a hindrance than a help, because he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet, they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby two-man tents.	1

5744	there were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor.  snape had returned with winky at his heels.  professor mcgonagall was right behind them.	1

4188	cho's head was on hermiones shoulder; the small silver-haired girl was ghostly green and pale.  harry struggled to fight off the mermen, but they laughed harder than ever, holding him back. harry looked wildly around.  where were the other champions?  would he have time to take ron to the surface and come back down for hermione and the others?  would he be able to find them again?  he looked down at his watch to see how much time was left - it had stopped working.	1
12234	though secondary importance ascribed to mathematics in education.	0
22086	let us do so, he replied.	0
4155	silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange, dark, foggy landscape.  he could only see ten feet around him, so that as he sped throuugh the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the incoming darkness:  forests of rippling, tangled black weed, wide plains of mud littered with dull, glimmering stones.  he swam deeper and deeper, out toward the middle of the lake, his eyes wide, staring through the eerily gray-lit water around him to the shadow beyond, where the water became opaque.	1
4190	got lost! he mouthed, looking panic-stricken.  fleur and krum're coming now!	1

2665	as he said it, his stomach flooded with a wave of molten panic.  he didn't mention this; he and hermione hadn't discussed what was coming in the first task much; he had the feeling she didn't want to think about it.	1

16482	well, but can you imagine that god will be willing to lie, whether in	0
15611	unjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the	0
21165	service to me, for i had to discuss them all the same. the women and	0

290	the electric fire shot across the room as the boarded-up fireplace burst outward, expelling mr. weasley, fred, george, and ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings.  aunt petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table; uncle vernon caught her before she hit the floor, and gaped, speechless, at the weasleys, all of whom had bright red hair, including fred and george, who were identical to the last freckle.	1

19915	next, how shall our soldiers treat their enemies? what about this?	0
594	now, with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting, they could see the city of tents that stretched in every direction.  they made their way slowly through the rows, staring eagerly around.  it was only just dawning on harry how many witches and wizards there must be in the world; he had never really thought much about those in other countries.	1

5027	bring them in, he said, and his voice echoed through the silent dungeon.	1
2573	i will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness, rita, said dumbledore, with a courteous bow and a smile, but i'm afraid we will have to discuss the matter later.  the weighing of the wands is about to start, and it cannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard.	1

183	he held up the envelope in which mrs. weasley's letter had come, and harry had to fight down a laugh.  every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front, into which mrs. weasley had squeezed the dursleys' address in minute writing.	1

3248	the last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed. rumors about the yule ball were flying everywhere, though harry didn't believe half of them - for instance, that dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from madam rosmerta. it seemed to be fact, however, that he had booked the weird sisters.  exactly who or what the weird sisters were harry didn't know, never having had access to a wizard's wireless, but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the wwn (wizarding wireless network) that they were a very famous musical group.	1

2524	viktor krum was standing moodily in a corner as usual and not talking to anybody. cedric and fheur were in conversation.  fheur looked a good deal happier than harry had seen her so far; she kept throwing back her head so that her long silvery hair caught the light.  a paunchy man, holding a large black camera that was smoking slightly, was watching fleur out of the corner of his eye.	1
12282	contemporaries. the modern world has either sneered at them as absurd,	0
5158	tired of walking in on harry, hermione, and ron all over the school.  professor mcgonagall had given them permission to use the empty transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes.  harry had soon mastered the impediment curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the reductor curse, which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and the four-point spell, a useful discovery of hermiones that would make his wand point due north, therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze.  he was still having trouble with the shield charm, though.  this was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed jelly-legs jinx, and harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counter-jinx.	1
20096	private or public is indeed a hard thing.	0
17241	why; and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the friend with	0

955	he took his small figure of krum out of his pocket, set it down on the ground, and watched it walk around. like the real krum, the model was slightly duck-footed and round-shouldered, much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick.  harry was listening for noise from the campsite.  everything seemed much quieter; perhaps the riot was over.	1

1360	as the train doors opened, there was a rumble of thunder overhead. hermione bundled up crookshanks in her cloak and ron left his dress robes over pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads bent and eyes narrowed against the downpour. the rain was now coming down so thick and fast that it was as though buckets of ice-cold water were being emptied repeatedly over their heads.	1

3673	an alarmingly large and ferocious-looking man, hagrid has been using his newfound authority to terrify the students in his care with a succession of horrific creatures. while dumbledore turns a blind eye, hagrid has maimed several pupils during a series of lessons that many admit to being very frightening.	1

17932	passing round the winecup, while their wheel is conveniently at hand,	0
4214	they pulled fleur's sister through the water, back toward the bank where the judges stood watching, twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of honor, singing their horrible screechy songs.	1

4663	no, said harry, without the faintest idea what crouch was talking about.	1
1326	maybe, said hermione, shrugging, or it might have muggle-repelling charms on it, like the world cup stadium.  and to keep foreign wizards from finding it, they'll have made it unplottable -	1

5929	and if i have?  he said, looking at dumbledore.  if i have discovered that you've been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet?  a parselmouth, eh?  and having funny turns all over the place -	1
4294	snape had glided over to their desk while they were talking. the whole class was now looking around at them; malfoy took the opportunity to flash potter stinks across the dungeon at harry.	1
1304	what rules?  said harry, ron, fred, and george together.	1
3223	you heard me, potter, said professor mcgonagall in a very final sort of way.	1

4707	over here, said harry, moving in front of dumbledore, leading the way through the trees.  he couldn't hear crouch's voice anymore, but he knew where he was going; it hadn't been much past the beauxbatons carriage . . . somewhere around here. . . .	1

2914	no, said harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude, no - i - i know what i'm going to do, thanks.	1

5652	he'll need to go to the hospital wing!  fudge was saying loudly.  he's ill, he's injured - dumbledore, diggory's parents, they're here, they're in the stands. ...	1
19836	and they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about	0

13520	of sin. hence they have a difficulty in receiving the first element of	0
16643	'rolling in the dirt, calling each man loudly by his name.'	0
1594	hagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious.	1
2489	ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her; harry turned and saw ron dragging hermione's hand away from her face.  it wasn't a pretty sight.  hermione's front teeth - already larger than average - were now growing at an alarming rate; she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated, past her bottom lip, toward her chin - panic-stricken, she felt them and let out a terrified cry.	1
24934	of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a bit?	0
4510	you couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you, hermione?  said ron angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them.  they won't want us visiting them now!  we could've tried to get more stuff out of winky about crouch!	1

3940	filch, i don't give a damn about that wretched poltergeist; it's my office that's -	1
1507	but at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors of the great hall banged open.	1
2753	harry pulled off the invisibility cloak and threw himself into an armchair in front of the fire.  the room was in semidarkness; the flames were the only source of light.  nearby, on a table, the support cedric diggory! badges the creeveys had been trying to improve were glinting in the firelight.  they now read potter really stinks.  harry looked back into the flames, and jumped.	1
25562	used on earth; and the description of it implied that there is one large	0
1396	on snape's other side was an empty seat, which harry guessed was professor mcgonagall's.  next to it, and in the very center of the table, sat professor dumbledore, the headmaster, his sweeping silver hair and beard shining in the candlelight, his magnificent deep green robes embroidered with many stars and moons.  the tips of dumbledore's long, thin fingers were together and he was resting his chin upon them, staring up at the ceiling through his half-moon spectacles as though lost in thought.  harry glanced up at the ceiling too.  it was enchanted to look like the sky outside, and he had never seen it look this stormy.  black and purple clouds were swirling across it, and as another thunderclap sounded outside, a fork of lightning flashed across it.	1
16162	for the task of guarding the city?	0
17004	so i should expect, he replied.	0

5150	of course she doesn't, said hermione sharply, looking up.  look what happened to hagrid when rita found out about his mother.  look at fudge, jumping to conclusions about her, just because she's part giant.  who needs that sort of prejudice?  i'd probably say i had big bones if i knew that's what i'd get for telling the truth.	1

11646	he had been first instead of last, his choice would have been the same.	0

777	next moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-gold comet came zooming into the stadium.  it did one circuit of the stadium, then split into two smaller comets, each hurtling toward the goal posts.  a rainbow arced suddenly across the field, connecting the two balls of light.  the crowd oooohed and aaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display.  now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged; they had formed a great shimmering shamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands.  something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it - excellent!  yelled ron as the shamrock soared over them, and heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing off their heads and seats.  squinting up at the shamrock, harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green.	1
24654	or public, which are likely to disorder his life, he will avoid?	0
23162	yes, he said, there are plenty of them--that is certain.	0

6111	oh yes she is, said hermione happily, brandishing the jar at them.	1

16062	but, said glaucon, interposing, you have not given them a relish to	0
16740	or that other tale of how hephaestus, because of similar goings on, cast	0

22001	yes, i said, and now having spoken of it, i must add how charming the	0

8947	the same time he does not wish to bring before us the fact that the city	0

6044	hagrid's chest swelled as he looked at harry.	1
10199	in love 'at first sight' with paradoxes respecting morality, some fancy	0
6075	it is my belief- and never have i so hoped that i am mistaken - that we are all facing dark and difficult times.  some of you in this hall have already suffered directly at the hands of lord voldemort.  many of your families have been torn asunder.  a week ago, a student was taken from our midst.	1

24443	yes, certainly; the best is the most natural.	0

11685	reason; why he should have supposed epic verse to be inseparably	0

19793	i agree with you, he replied.	0
5624	and harry ran as he had never run in his life, knocking two stunned death eaters aside as he passed; he zigzagged behind headstones, feeling their curses following him, hearing them hit the headstones - he was dodging curses and graves, pelting toward cedric's body, no longer aware of the pain in his leg, his whole being concentrated on what he had to do -	1

5282	the spell shot straight through the mist, leaving it intact.  he supposed he should have known better; the reductor curse was for solid objects.  what would happen if he walked through the mist?  was it worth chancing it, or should he double back?	1

11393	better faculty in the soul, as the arts of imitation are to the worse.	0
5202	but the task's not till tonight!  said harry, accidentally spilling scrambled eggs down his front, afraid he had mistaken the time.	1
25334	evil and unrighteous, then, if the speaker is right, i suppose that	0
10975	state there are only a few such, and these in time of war go out and	0

1359	ron's bad mood continued for the rest of the journey. he didn't talk much as they changed into their school robes, and was still glowering when the hogwarts express slowed down at last and finally stopped in the pitch-darkness of hogsmeade station.	1

2071	they walked over to the gryffindor table and sat down. ron took care to sit on the side facing the doorway, because krum and his fellow durmstrang students were still gathered around it, apparently unsure about where they should sit.  the students from beauxbatons had chosen seats at the ravenclaw table.  they were looking around the great hall with glum expressions on their faces.  three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads.	1

21086	surface. this is no easy task. but whether easy or not, herein will lie	0
4865	well, i think harry's got it now, anyway, said hermione hastily.  and we don't have to worry about disarming, because he's been able to do that for ages. ... i think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening.	1
22636	that nothing more need be said.	0
23631	in the chariot of state with the reins in his hand, no longer protector,	0
3035	yep, said fred, grinning at her. he put on a high-pitched squeak and imitated a house-elf.  'anything we can get you, sir, anything at all!'  they're dead helpful... get me a roast ox if i said i was peckish.	1
2379	i'm not hungry, i had enough at the feast -	1
21430	science and truth, and yet surpasses them in beauty; for you surely	0
2664	rita skeeter and her photographer friend had just emerged from the three broomsticks pub.  talking in low voices, they passed right by hermione without hooking at her.  harry backed into the wall of honeydukes to stop rita skeeter from hitting him with her crocodile-skin handbag.  when they were gone, harry said, she's staying in the village.  i bet she's coming to watch the first task.	1

10684	each of these governments and individuals has a corresponding	0

5569	the death eaters were laughing again.  voldemorts lipless mouth was smiling.  harry did not bow.  he was not going to let voldemort play with him before killing him ... he was not going to give him that satisfaction. . . .	1
2203	hagrid was wearing his best (and very horrible) hairy brown suit, plus a checked yellow-and-orange tie.  this wasn't the worst of it, though; he had evidently tried to tame his hair, using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease.  it was now slicked down into two bunches - perhaps he had tried a ponytail like bill's, but found he had too much hair. the look didn't really suit hagrid at all. for a moment, hermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, she said, erm - where are the skrewts.	1

23485	that is what i am doing, i replied; and i must add that no one who	0

14282	i went down yesterday to the piraeus with glaucon the son of ariston,	0
1920	it was the most wonderful feeling.  harry felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness. he stood there feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of everyone watching him.	1

20370	thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the	0

19376	that we have now escaped; the wave has not swallowed us up alive for	0

94	the cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire, but frank couldn't see the speaker.  the snake, on the other hand, was curled up on the rotting hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet dog.	1
6913	language of men proves this--our 'gracious' and 'blessed' tyrant and the	0

6024	harry returned to gryffindor tower the following evening.  from what hermione and ron told him, dumbledore had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast.  he had merely requested that they leave harry alone, that nobody ask him questions or badger him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze.  most people, he noticed, were skirting him in the corridors, avoiding his eyes.  some whispered behind their hands as he passed.  he guessed that many of them had believed rita skeeter's article about how disturbed and possibly dangerous he was.  perhaps they were formulating their own theories about how cedric had died.  he found he didn't care very much.  he liked it best when he was with ron and hermione and they were talking about other things, or else letting him sit in silence while they played chess.  he felt as though all three of them had reached an understanding they didn't need to put into words; that each was waiting for some sign, some word, of what was going on outside hogwarts - and that it was useless to speculate about what might be coming until they knew anything for certain.  the only time they touched upon the subject was when ron told harry about a meeting mrs. weasley had had with dumbledore before going home.	1

11428	the pleasure. but the inevitable consequence is that he who begins by	0

5171	it's about me, isn't it? said harry.	1
1618	but harry's thoughts had drifted.  the perfumed fire always made him feel sleepy and dull-witted, and professor trelawney's rambling talks on fortune-telling never held him exactly spellbound - though he couldn't help thinking about what she had just said to him. i fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass...'	1

3979	there was a pause.  snape and moody were still staring at each other, mrs. norris gave a loud meow, still peering around filch's legs, looking for the source of harry's bubble-bath smell.	1
5868	i will say it again, said dumbledore as the phoenix rose into the air and resettled itself upon the perch beside the door.  you have shown bravery beyond anything i could have expected of you tonight.  harry.  you have shown bravery equal to those who died fighting voldemort at the height of his powers.  you have shouldered a grown wizard's burden and found yourself equal to it - and you have now given us all we have a right to expect.  you will come with me to the hospital wing.  i do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight.  a sleeping potion, and some peace . . . sirius, would you like to stay with him?	1

5707	it hasn't been easy, harry, guiding you through these tasks without arousing suspicion.  i have had to use every ounce of cunning i possess, so that my hand would not be detectable in your success.  dumbledore would have been very suspicious if you had managed everything too easily.  as long as you got into that maze, preferably with a decent head start - then, i knew, i would have a chance of getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way clear.  but i also had to contend with your stupidity.  the second task . . . that was when i was most afraid we would fail.  i was keeping watch on you, potter.  i knew you hadn't worked out the egg's clue, so i had to give you another hint -	1

4578	well, rita's definitely not using an invisibility cloak!  hermione panted five minutes later, catching up with harry and ron in the entrance hall and pulling harrys hand away from one of his wiggling ears so that he could hear her.  moody says he didn't see her anywhere near the judges' table at the second task, or anywhere near the lake!	1

3825	dumbledore left the cabin, pausing only to scratch fangs ears.  when the door had shut behind him, hagrid began to sob into his dustbin-lid-sized hands.  hermione kept patting his arm, and at last, hagrid looked up, his eyes very red indeed, and said, great man, dumbledore . . . great man . ..	1

13171	like the rest of the republic they are partly greek and partly ideal,	0

5592	and then - nothing could have prepared harry for this - he felt his feet lift from the ground.  he and voldemort were both being raised into the air, their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light.  they glided away from the tombstone of voldemort's father and then came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves. . . . the death eaters were shouting; they were asking voldemort for instructions; they were closing in, reforming the circle around harry and voldemort, the snake slithering at their heels, some of them drawing their wands -	1

4067	harry nodded, but even as he did so, an insane urge to confess that he didn't have any idea how to survive at the bottom of the lake for an hour came over him.  he looked up at hagrid - perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes, to deal with the creatures in it?  he looked after everything else on the grounds, after all-	1

5614	and now another head was emerging from the tip of voldemorts wand . . . and harry knew when he saw it who it would be ... he knew, as though he had expected it from the moment when cedric had appeared from the wand . . . knew, because the man appearing was the one he'd thought of more than any other tonight. . . .	1

131	yes, that would be hermione's advice:  go straight to the headmaster of hogwarts, and in the meantime, consult a book.  harry stared out of the window at the inky blue-black sky. he doubted very much whether a book could help him now.  as far as he knew, he was the only living person to have survived a curse like voldemort's; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he would find his symptoms listed in common magical ailments and afflictions.  as for informing the headmaster, harry had no idea where dumbledore went during the summer holidays.  he amused himself for a moment, picturing dumbledore, with his long silver beard, full length wizard's robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose.  wherever dumbledore was, though, harry was sure that hedwig would be able to find him; harry's owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone, even without an address.  but what would he write?	1
1873	we start by recruiting members, said hermione happily. i thought two sickles to join - that buys a badge - and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign.  you're treasurer, ron - i've got you a collecting tin upstairs - and harry, you're secretary, so you might want to write down everything i'm saying now, as a record of our first meeting.	1

1395	harry scanned the table more carefully.  tiny little professor flitwick, the charms teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside professor sprout, the herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray hair.  she was talking to professor sinistra of the astronomy department.  on professor sinistra's other side was the sallow-faced, hook-nosed, greasy-haired potions master, snape - harry's least favorite person at hogwarts.  harry's loathing of snape was matched only by snape's hatred of him, a hatred which had, if possible, intensified last year, when harry had helped sirius escape right under snape's overlarge nose - snape and sirius had been enemies since their own school days.	1

2678	he wondered how the other champions were feeling.  every time he had seen cedric lately, he had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but excited.  harry glimpsed fleur delacour from time to time in the corridors; she looked exactly as she always did, haughty and unruffled.  and krum just sat in the library, poring over books.	1

2298	did you ask an older student to put it into the goblet of fire for you? said professor dumbledore, ignoring snape.	1
3474	dumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table, but karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like ron's as he watched krum and hermione draw nearer. ludo bagman, tonight in robes of bright purple with large yellow stars, was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the students; and madame maxime, who had changed her usual uniform of black satin for a flowing gown of lavender silk, was applauding them politely. but mr. crouch, harry suddenly realized, was not there.  the fifth seat at the table was occupied by percy weasley.	1
2875	what d'you think i'm trying to do?  said harry angrily.  a great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason...okay, try again. . . .	1

10992	of a tyrant by nature, and leads the life of a tyrant for the longest	0

18225	with the assumption that our state, if rightly ordered, is perfect.	0
3681	harry finished reading and looked up at ron, whose mouth was hanging open.	1
24130	come then, i said, and as the general umpire in theatrical contests	0
24652	and, for the same reason, he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours	0
21935	yes, he said, these intimations which the soul receives are very curious	0
4542	harry took off his watch, which he was only wearing out of habit, as it didn't work anymore, and stuffed it into his pocket.  then he picked up a niffler.  it put its long snout in harry's ear and sniffed enthusiastically. it was really quite cuddly.	1
19762	some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians	0
9596	and to this new mythology the men of a later generation began to attach	0
7311	the renowned hero,' as the elegiac poet terms them; but he does not	0
7506	only learn the true lesson which is to be gathered from them when we	0

12267	worst of them is tyranny. the truth is, that the question has hardly any	0
4252	one of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake, which meant that ron was getting to share harry's limelight for once.  harry noticed that ron's version of events changed subtly with every retelling.  at first, he gave what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with hermione's story, anyway - dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in professor mcgonagall's office, first assuring them that they would be quite safe, and would awake when they were back above the water.  one week later, however, ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled single-handedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into submission before tying him up.	1
15637	proof; and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of	0
22738	end, even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever, but will	0
11514	in good to him, either in life or after death, even what appears to	0
16764	to him, he is guilty of downright impiety. as little can i believe the	0
17506	same. but they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate	0

20157	of judging what is good and what is not, such an one we maintain not	0
9382	of the monastic orders, or the reformers, owing to some peculiarity in	0

376	mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning fred and george's room, said ron quietly.  great long price lists for stuff they've invented.  joke stuff, you know.  fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff.  it was brilliant, i never knew they'd been inventing all that . . .	1

5289	he shut his eyes, so he wouldn't be able to see the view of endless space below him, and pulled his right foot as hard as he could away from the grassy ceiling.	1
5231	mr. diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry, but his wife laid a hand on his arm, and he merely shrugged and turned away.	1
5686	but harry had suddenly remembered.  he should have told dumbledore, he should have said it straightaway -	1
12179	of life, which are the reverse of spartan. plato wishes to give his	0
2174	and all the hufflepuffs are talking about diggory, said seamus contemptuously.  but i wouldn't have thought he'd have wanted to risk his good looks.	1
23964	is the waking reality of what we dreamed.	0
25805	the work.  you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by	0
5843	the wands connected?  he said, looking from harry to dumbledore.  why?	1
11389	comes in to save our bewildered minds from the power of appearance; for,	0
5657	girls were screaming, sobbing hysterically.... the scene flickered oddly before harry's eyes. . . .	1
17517	a god, we maintain that he was not avaricious; or, if he was avaricious,	0
8698	and women have common duties and pursuits. a second and greater wave is	0

6681	repeating the notions of other men. there is no evidence that either the	0

1780	there was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as though a vast, invisible something was soaring through the air - instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but unmistakably dead.  several of the students stifled cries; ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him.	1
14657	that good is the debt which a just man owes to his friends, and evil the	0
25980	literary archive foundation are tax deductible to the full extent	0
2193	what d'you reckon'll happen to the ones who aren't chosen?  ron muttered to harry as the veela-girl dropped her parchment into the goblet of fire.  reckon they'll go back to school, or hang around to watch the tournament?	1
7656	has not the question been already answered, for we have decided that one	0
11384	and now let us enquire, what is the faculty in man which answers to	0
6360	to poetry are finally determined, and the happiness of the citizens	0
8531	will not proceed a step without first clearing the ground. this leads	0
4048	yeah, i don't fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head, said harry.  i s'pose i could always attack someone in front of moody; he might do it for me....	1
6410	like the other second titles of the platonic dialogues, may therefore be	0
13441	a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit and	0
15166	yes, that is what i say, and i have given you my reasons.	0
12224	(greek), were required to submit to a severe training in order to	0
1751	total control, said moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began to roll over and over.  i could make it jump out of the window, drown itself, throw itself down one of your throats. . .	1
8188	in physical and moral qualities. the care of the governors should be	0
1235	well, they're okay! said ron angrily, looking at harry's robes. why couldn't i have some like that?	1
8158	expected to do his own work. the happiness resides not in this or that	0
16934	yes, i did; and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot	0
22465	the same practice may be followed, i said, in all these things--labours,	0
16701	subversive and destructive of ship or state.	0
5097	neither dumbledore nor harry spoke for a while.  dumbledore was gazing across the room, and, every now and then, placing his wand tip to his temple and adding another shining silver thought to the seething mass within the pensieve.	1
5834	he took a deep breath and began to tell them.  as he spoke, visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes; he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived voldemort; he saw the death eaters apparating between the graves around them; he saw cedric's body, lying on the ground beside the cup.	1
4871	he was quite right.  the dimly lit room was swelteringly hot.  the fumes from the perfumed fire were heavier than ever.  harrys head swam as he made his way over to one of the curtained windows.  while professor trelawney was looking the other way, disentangling her shawl from a lamp, he opened it an inch or so and settled back in his chintz armchair, so that a soft breeze played across his face. it was extremely comfortable.	1
11412	mixed multitude who have no experience of her. thus the poet is like the	0
2244	dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arm's length, so that he could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to blue-white.	1
22744	to the knowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and	0
17899	mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting guard?	0
2506	snape's eyes met harry's, and harry knew what was coming.  snape was going to poison him.  harry imagined picking up his cauldron, and sprinting to the front of the class, and bringing it down on snape's greasy head - and then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on harry's thoughts.	1
5054	i quite understand, said dumbledore.  he lifted the basin, carried it over to his desk, placed it upon the polished top, and sat down in the chair behind it.  he motioned for harry to sit down opposite him.	1
24597	and why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach? only because	0
11338	virtues, must we not infer that they are under a similar delusion? they	0
12909	linked together. nor is there any ground for supposing that marriages	0
3675	hagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation, however. in conversation with a daily prophet reporter last month, he admitted breeding creatures he has dubbed blast-ended skrewts, highly dangerous crosses between manti-cores and fire-crabs.  the creation of new breeds of magical creature is, of course, an activity usually closely observed by the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures. hagrid, however, considers himself to be above such petty restrictions.	1
970	what the - ?  gasped ron as he sprang to his feet again, staring up at the thing that had appeared.	1
21094	and when they are filling in the work, as i conceive, they will often	0
389	you might sneer, ron, he said heatedly, but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow-bottomed products that seriously endanger -	1
15957	are diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different	0
6809	justice into two unconnected precepts, which have no common principle,	0
20563	then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from	0
6285	more necessary because it is not made by aristotle himself. the two	0
19846	wings, in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape.	0

16409	is the author of their misery--the poet is not to be permitted to say;	0
688	he pushed his undrunk tea back at percy and waited for ludo to rise; bagman struggled to his feet, swigging down the last of his tea, the gold in his pockets chinking merrily.	1
10146	disordered in two different ways. first, there have been great men who,	0
1811	i don't know, said hermione, looking pensive.	1
8509	harmoniously in every relation of life. and injustice, which is the	0
9044	the point which has to be considered, is the origin of this corruption	0
20076	change, if possible, be of one thing only, or, if not, of two; at any	0
2108	of course she isn't! said hermione tartly.  i don't see anyone else gaping at her like an idiot!	1
3216	harry's insides seemed to curl up and shrivel.	1
4138	where have you been? said a bossy, disapproving voice.  the task's about to start!	1
20012	good to the state. i will add, what you have omitted, that your citizens	0
18830	also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the state	0
4402	harry, ron, and hermione shook their heads.	1
24670	there is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule	0
18740	forbidding him, which is other and stronger than the principle which	0
13409	abstract essences or universal ideas of all things, and connects them;	0
887	the colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished.  dark figures were blundering through the trees; children were crying; anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air.  harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see.  then he heard ron yell with pain.	1
23761	ask, how is he formed out of the democratical? and how does he live, in	0
7103	better, and will therefore be more loved by them than the just.'	0
14977	the unjust is lord over the truly simple and just: he is the stronger,	0
16300	the poets, who have ever been the great story-tellers of mankind.	0
4299	'. . . harry potter's well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate.'  how very touching, sneered snape, rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the slytherins.  well, i think i had better separate the three of you, so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives. weasley, you stay here. miss granger, over there, beside miss parkinson. potter - that table in front of my desk. move. now.	1

16176	and is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog	0
14582	good, and to hate those whom he thinks evil.	0
1375	i shall call the headmaster! shouted professor mcgonagall.  i'm warning you, peeves -	1
19078	the best, is also doubtful. hence i feel a reluctance to approach the	0
5078	voldemort got a letter from an owl.  he said something like, wormtail's blunder had been repaired.  he said someone was dead.  then he said, wormtail wouldn't be fed to the snake - there was a snake beside his chair.  he said - he said he'd be feeding me to it,	1
18938	and the just state, and the nature of justice in each of them, we should	0
7164	is right; but from you i expect better things. and please, as glaucon	0
14607	what was the error, polemarchus? i asked.	0
2422	i'm not teiling him anything, hermione said shortly.  tell him yourself.  it's the only way to sort this out.	1
20340	there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty--in whose opinion	0
17934	make every class happy--and then, as you imagine, the whole state would	0

25950	with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,	0
13882	which he touchingly describes. he sees no hope of happiness or peace	0
25313	that the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself, which is	0
18430	this country: watch therefore and strive to catch a sight of her, and if	0
5810	minerva, could i ask you to stand guard here while i take harry upstairs?	1
17309	in it should be careful and should continue through life. now my belief	0
17325	but next, what shall we say of their food; for the men are in training	0
11858	works of art have a permanent element; they idealize and detain the	0
4117	dobby knows, sir!  harry potter has to go into the lake and find his wheezy -	1
17612	on the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness.	0
9619	at, better than he did himself. we are beginning to realize what he saw	0
12022	to the rainbow in respect not of form but of colour, and not to the	0
15917	a state, i said, arises, as i conceive, out of the needs of mankind;	0
23592	the tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim	0
7735	soul is related to the body as a cause to an effect, and therefore if we	0
10247	to another argument,--and so here we are.' suppose that we put ourselves	0
22432	certainly not, i said; and yet perhaps, in thus turning jest into	0

9450	such a vision of a priori knowledge he is sufficiently justified, or at	0
15416	and the ear has an end and an excellence also?	0

4278	hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter. scarlet woman? she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at ron.	1
16142	and at no other; he was not to let opportunities slip, and then he would	0
23544	suffer a word to be said on the other side; hence in democracies almost	0
10914	a power of number far beyond what he could see realized in the world	0
11581	(the moon) shone by the light of the seventh--the second and fifth	0
5912	why he killed them?  well, that's no mystery, is it?  blustered fudge.  he was a raving lunatic!  from what minerva and severus have told me, he seems to have thought he was doing it all on you-know-who's instructions!	1
9485	pythagorean principle of number found a place, and was, as aristotle	0
1616	her voice dropped almost to a whisper.  ron rolled his eyes at harry, who looked stonily back.  professor trelawney swept past them and seated herself in a large winged armchair before the fire, facing the class.  lavender brown and parvati patil, who deeply admired professor trelawney, were sitting on poufs very close to her.	1
15585	of the ring, and always with the same result--when he turned the collet	0
21229	falls short of the whole truth is not fair measure; for nothing	0
10263	went on to the individual, so now, beginning with timocracy, let us	0
3441	they're . . . they're really . . . well, thanks, dobby, said harry, and he pulled them on, causing dobby's eyes to leak with happiness again.	1
14005	in the same class, priests, women, noblemen, gentlemen, and 'sturdy and	0
8064	indefinite and almost absolute control which the soul is supposed to	0
13616	them unaltered seems to be the origin of what at first sight is very	0
15244	and you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?	0

9374	his highest development in a congenial state or family, among friends	0

2604	thank you all, said dumbledore, standing up at the judges' table. you may go back to your lessons now - or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to end -	1
1220	he heaved a pile of parcels onto harry's camp bed and dropped the money bag and a load of socks next to it.  harry started unwrapping the shopping.  apart from the standard book of spells, grade 4, by miranda goshawk, he had a handful of new quills, a dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for his potion-making kit - he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna.  he was just piling underwear into his cauldron when ron made a loud noise of disgust behind him.	1

5272	the path ahead was empty too, and when harry reached a right turn and took it, he again found his way unblocked.  harry didn't know why, but the lack of obstacles was unnerving him.  surely he should have met something by now?  it felt as though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security.  then he heard movement right behind him.  he held out his wand, ready to attack, but its beam fell only upon cedric, who had just hurried out of a path on the right-hand side.  cedric looked severely shaken.  the sleeve of his robe was smoking.	1

2876	he wanted to skip divination to keep practicing, but hermione refused point-blank to skive off arithmancy, and there was no point in staying without her.  he therefore had to endure over an hour of professor trelawney, who spent half the lesson telling everyone that the position of mars with relation to saturn at that moment meant that people born in july were in great danger of sudden, violent deaths.	1

812	as mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again, clutching the quaffle tightly under her arm, the bulgarian keeper, zograf, flew out to meet her.  whatever happened was over so quickly harry didn't catch it, but a scream of rage from the irish crowd, and mostafa's long, shrill whistle blast, told him it had been a foul.	1
18906	are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such	0

4407	well, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others. crouch's principles might've been good in the beginning - i wouldn't know.  he rose quickly through the ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against voldemorts supporters.  the aurors were given new powers - powers to kill rather than capture, for instance.  and i wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial. crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the unforgivable curses against suspects.  i would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the dark side.  he had his supporters, mind you - plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as minister of magic. when voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a matter of time until crouch got the top job. but then something rather unfortunate happened. ...  sirius smiled grimly.  crouch's own son was caught with a group of death eaters who'd managed to talk their way out of azkaban. apparently they were trying to find voldemort and return him to power.	1

14938	then, i said, no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of the	0
15499	care of the sick, and the physician's art; also the various ways of	0

686	oh details!  said bagman, waving the word away like a cloud of midges.  they've signed, haven't they?  they've agreed, haven't they?  i bet you anything these kids'll know soon enough anyway.  i mean, it's happening at hogwarts -	1
13757	6. others as well as plato have chosen an ideal republic to be the	0
17738	their youth upwards, and make them perform actions in which they are	0
22478	together, and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them	0
502	it's been a massive organizational problem, sighed mr. weasley.  the trouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the world cup, and of course, we just haven't got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all.  there are places muggles can't penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into diagon alley or platform nine and three-quarters.  so we had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many anti-muggle precautions as possible.  the whole ministry's been working on it for months.  first, of course, we have to stagger the arrivals.  people with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand.  a limited number use muggle transport, but we can't have too many clogging up their buses and trains - remember, wizards are coming from all over the world.  some apparate, of course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well away from muggles.  i believe there's a handy wood they're using as the apparition point.  for those who don't want to apparate, or can't, we use portkeys.  they're objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time.  you can do large groups at a time if you need to.  there have been two hundred portkeys placed at strategic points around britain, and the nearest one to us is up at the top of stoatshead hill, so that's where we're headed.	1
790	and here, all the way from egypt, our referee, acclaimed chairwizard of the international association of quidditch, hassan mostafa!	1
8365	into the distance, justice is tumbling out at our feet. we are as bad	0
15034	may be others who are in the same predicament with myself. perhaps we	0
3621	cedric looked as though he didn't want to say whatever it was in front of ron, who shrugged, looking bad-tempered, and continued to climb the stairs.	1
3694	that was a really good lesson, said hermione as they entered the great hall.  i didn't know half the things professor grubbly-plank told us about uni -	1
7892	ethics and psychology, as well as about diet and medicine; attempting	0
9234	light; without which the sight will not distinguish between colours and	0
7105	unequal fray. he considered that the most important point of all had	0
4350	what if they catch you? what if you're seen?	1
25052	not strife and inconsistency in his life? though i need hardly raise the	0
1447	the table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; harry could see malfoy clapping as baddock joined the slytherins.  harry wondered whether baddock knew that slytherin house had turned out more dark witches and wizards than any other.  fred and george hissed malcolm baddock as he sat down.	1
10145	been two sorts of politicians or statesmen, whose eyesight has become	0
9520	to correspond. but there is a knowledge of the understanding which	0
654	don't be a spoilsport, arthur!  boomed ludo bagman, rattling his pockets excitedly. they're old enough to know what they want!  you reckon ireland will win but krum'll get the snitch?  not a chance, boys, not a chance.... i'll give you excellent odds on that one .... we'll add five galleons for the funny wand, then, shall we....	1
566	is that right? said mr. weasley, his hand held out for his change, but mr. roberts didn't give it to him.	1
3214	profesor mcgonagall looked suspiciously at him, as though she thought he was trying to be funny.	1

996	but none of the ministry wizards apart from mr. crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that harry, ron, or hermione had conjured the skull; on the contrary, at hermione's words, they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees.	1

292	tall, thin, and balding, he moved toward uncle vernon, his hand outstretched, but uncle vernon backed away several paces, dragging aunt petunia.  words utterly failed uncle vernon.  his best suit was covered in white dust, which had settled in his hair and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty years.	1

2118	the moment has come, said dumbledore, smiling around at the sea of upturned faces. the triwizard tournament is about to start. i would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket --	1
1074	harry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free was to present it with proper garments.  it was pitiful to see the way winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over mr. crouch's feet.	1
16239	then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will	0
24033	and also the soul which is under a tyrant (i am speaking of the soul	0
19481	with the inferior, as seldom as possible; and that they should rear the	0
16626	fortune, is to him of all men least terrible.	0
15459	then the just is happy, and the unjust miserable?	0
22296	are the paths which lead thither; for these paths will also lead to our	0
13981	all other, calling them profane, and the followers of them wicked and	0
23582	the people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse	0
6500	do as well as any other); for a writer of fiction, and especially a	0
20894	there can be no question of it.	0
22645	such as we were describing, which are common to all, and contain nothing	0
11975	is both false and contrary to the spirit of plato (rep.). it may be	0
20742	shouting and clapping their hands, and the echo of the rocks and the	0
18595	then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or	0
8894	waking vision of absolute justice or beauty or truth; they have not the	0
12684	only the growth of history and experience. we ask what is the origin of	0

17595	what then is the real object of them?	0

18757	well, i said, there is a story which i remember to have heard, and in	0

879	a crowd of wizards, tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upward, was marching slowly across the field. harry squinted at them. . . . they didn't seem to have faces. . . . then he realized that their heads were hooded and their faces masked.  high above them, floating along in midair, four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes.  it was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers, and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air. two of the figures were very small.	1

23801	which i desire to note is that in all of us, even in good men, there is	0
1520	moody seemed totally indifferent to his less-than-warm welcome.  ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in front of him, he reached again into his traveling cloak, pulled out a hip flask, and took a long draught from it.  as he lifted his arm to drink, his cloak was pulled a few inches from the ground, and harry saw, below the table, several inches of carved wooden leg, ending in a clawed foot.	1

181	uncle vernon finished reading, put his hand back into his breast pocket, and drew out something else.	1
999	amos, be careful! said a few of the wizards warningly as mr. diggory squared his shoulders, raised his wand, marched across the clearing, and disappeared into the darkness. hermione watched him vanish with her hands over her mouth.	1

4177	harry sped toward the hostages, half expecting the merpeople to lower their spears and charge at him, but they did nothing.  the ropes of weed tying the hostages to the statue were thick, slimy, and very strong.  for a fleeting second he thought of the knife sirius had bought him for christmas - locked in his trunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away, no use to him whatsoever.	1
11556	'actually saw this terrible sight. at the entrance of the chasm, as we	0

1101	no, said mr. weasley. we found barry crouch's elf holding harry's wand, but we're none the wiser about who actually conured the mark.	1
5269	harry kept looking behind him.  the old feeling that he was being watched was upon him.  the maze was growing darker with every passing minute as the sky overhead deepened to navy.  he reached a second fork.	1
8003	sense independent of any special experience of good or evil.	0
3773	ha, ha, ha, said hermione sarcastically.  goblins don't need protection.  haven't you been listening to what professor binns has been telling us about goblin rebellions?	1

13286	their treatment of them (rep.). in two thousand years their art has made	0
15211	and how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the	0
11012	better part is enslaved to the worse. he cannot do what he would, and	0
164	aunt petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where uncle vernon had got to.  she didn't have to wait long to find out; after about a minute, he was back.  he looked livid.	1

1035	you dropped it? repeated mr. diggory in disbelief.  is this a confession?  you threw it aside after you conjured the mark?	1
3236	on the whole. harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him, life had definitely improved since he had got through the first task.  he wasn't attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore, which he suspected had a lot to do with cedric - he had an idea cedric might have told the hufflepuffs to leave harry alone, in gratitude for harry's tip-off about the dragons.  there seemed to be fewer support cedric diggory! badges around too.  draco malfoy, of course, was still quoting rita skeeter's article to him at every possible opportunity, but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it - and just to heighten harry's feeling of well-being, no story about hagrid had appeared in the daily prophet.	1
18767	as though they were two distinct things.	0
9648	from the wall, the voices of the passengers will seem to proceed from	0
24355	the pain which they experience to be real, and in like manner, when	0

379	o.w.l.s were ordinary wizarding levels, the examinations hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen.	1
7519	plato, and here, as in the phaedrus, though for a different reason, was	0
18049	the lower classes, when naturally superior. the intention was, that, in	0
22374	and is set over them; no other science can be placed higher--the nature	0
25157	praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he	0
6853	your enemies.' either of these explanations gives a sufficient rule	0
9535	universal existence are the mathematical sciences, which also contain	0

18321	and no washing either with lyes or without them can take away the bloom.	0
23577	oligarchs in reality; they do not wish to be, but the sting of the	0
16074	why, he said, you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life.	0
15902	more easily discernible. i propose therefore that we enquire into the	0
12817	greeks; and this superiority he was disposed to attribute to the laws	0
9583	sciences can never rise above themselves into the sphere of our higher	0
12371	few, may also furnish the means of the highest culture to all, and will	0

3253	it's christmas, hermione, said harry lazily; he was rereading flying with the cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire.	1
18211	you are right, and we will do as you propose.	0
18290	again, i said, there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage,	0
8532	him into a tiresome digression, which is intended to explain the nature	0

17039	and shall we receive into our state all the three styles, or one only of	0
3203	the yule ball is approaching - a traditional part of the triwizard tournament and an opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign guests.  now, the ball will be open only to fourth years and above - although you may invite a younger student if you wish -	1
10695	extravagances of character, is in reality only a state of weakness and	0

18931	of politics or private business; always thinking and calling that which	0
3428	nah . . . presents! said seamus, spotting the large pile at the foot of his bed. ron, dean, and neville decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some present-opening too.  harry turned back to dobby, who was now standing nervously next to harrys bed, still looking worried that he had upset harry.  there was a christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea cozy.	1

5555	but how to get at harry potter?  for he has been better protected than i think even he knows, protected in ways devised by dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy's future.  dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the boy's protection as long as he is in his relations' care.  not even i can touch him there. . . . then, of course, there was the quidditch world cup. ... i thought his protection might be weaker there, away from his relations and dumbledore, but i was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of ministry wizards.  and then, the boy would return to hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that muggle-loving fool from morning until night.  so how could i take him?	1

6816	asks, what is this due and proper thing which justice does, and to whom?	0
744	the box filled gradually around them over the next half hour.  mr. weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards.  percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog.  when cornelius fudge, the minister of magic himself, arrived, percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered. highly embarrassed, he repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat, throwing jealous looks at harry, whom cornelius fudge had greeted like an old friend.  they had met before, and fudge shook harry's hand in a fatherly fashion, asked how he was, and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him.	1

2816	by the time harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase, cedric was at the top. he was with a load of sixth-year friends.  harry didn't want to talk to cedric in front of them; they were among those who had been quoting rita skeeter's article at him every time he went near them.  he followed cedric at a distance and saw that he was heading toward the charms corridor.  this gave harry an idea.  pausing at a distance from them, he pulled out his wand, and took careful aim.	1

595	their fellow campers were starting to wake up.  first to stir were the families with small children; harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before.  a tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid-shaped tent, holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami.  as they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent.	1

245	uncle vernon had put on his best suit.  to some people, this might have looked like a gesture of welcome, but harry knew it was because uncle vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating.  dudley, on the other hand, looked somehow diminished.  this was not because the diet was at last taking effect, but due to fright.  dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pig's tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and aunt petunia and uncle vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in london.  it wasn't altogether surprising, therefore, that dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside, and walking sideways from room to room, so as not to present the same target to the enemy.	1
11402	reason and law control him and enjoin patience; since he cannot know	0
2272	well.. . through the door, harry, said dumbledore. he wasn't smiling.	1
155	however, at the bottom of the report there were a few well-chosen comments from the school nurse that not even uncle vernon and aunt petunia could explain away.  no matter how much aunt petunia wailed that dudley was big-boned, and that his poundage was really puppy fat, and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty of food, the fact remained that the school outfitters didn't stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore.  the school nurse had seen what aunt petunia's eyes - so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors - simply refused to see:  that far from needing extra nourishment, dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale.	1

8680	differ from men in capacity, do not men equally differ from one another?	0
2746	who's there?  said karkaroff again, very suspiciously, looking around in the darkness.  harry remained still and silent.  after a minute or so, karkaroff seemed to decide that he had hit some sort of animal; he was looking around at waist height, as though expecting to see a dog.  then he crept back under the cover of the trees and started to edge forward toward the place where the dragons were.	1
8039	gravity and verisimilitude with which the tale is told, and the analogy	0
11549	were in the same proportion. he added something hardly worth repeating	0
20443	shall also acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible, and	0
4084	harry, ron, and hermione looked up.  fred and george had just emerged from behind some bookshelves.	1

6621	relation of the philosopher to the world, to whom a state of simplicity	0
21751	when they might have a better?	0
15261	say or do the same as his like in the same case?	0
15219	and what of the unjust--does he claim to have more than the just man and	0
10929	is no conceivable folly or crime, however cruel or unnatural, of which,	0
3424	it's okay, said harry, still breathing rather faster than usual, while his heart rate returned to normal.  just - just prod me or something in future, all right, don't bend over me like that. ..	1
24100	things which other freemen desire to see, but he lives in his hole like	0
9523	hypotheses--images because they are clothed in sense, hypotheses because	0
13105	his own party, as the world without him becomes stronger. this seems to	0
23011	as you say, he seemed to be a ruler, but was only a spendthrift.	0

3039	going to try and lead the house-elves out on strike now, are you? said george. going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion?	1

4969	ah, i was forgetting . . . you don't like the dementors, do you, albus? said moody with a sardonic smile.	1

9169	perhaps the world will doubt the existence of such an artist. what will	0
6368	perversions. these two points of view are really opposed, and the	0
3976	snape was looking down at moody, and harry couldn't see the expression on his face. for a moment, nobody moved or said anything.  then snape slowly lowered his hands.	1
20211	participate in the idea, neither putting the objects in the place of the	0
5137	everything harry had seen in the pensieve, nearly everything dumbledore had told and shown him afterward, he had now shared with ron and hermione - and, of course, with sirius, to whom harry had sent an owl the moment he had left dumbledore's office.  harry, ron, and hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night, talking it all over until harry's mind was reeling, until he understood what dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off.	1

23901	truly, then, i said, a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and	0
19856	another and to their enemies? i should be inclined to propose that the	0
10225	agamemnon could not have counted his feet; the art by which we are made	0
8949	each hymeneal festival. if it were worth while to argue seriously about	0
12587	divided; and in times of sickness or moments of self-indulgence they	0

3250	harry had used during the first task of the triwizard tournament.  other teachers were not so generous.  nothing would ever deflect professor binns, for example, from plowing on through his notes on goblin rebellions - as binns hadn't let his own death stand in the way of continuing to teach, they supposed a small thing like christmas wasn't going to put him off.  it was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as percys cauldron-bottom report.  professors mcgonagall and moody kept them working until the very last second of their classes too, and snape, of course, would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt harry.  staring nastily around at them all, he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the term.	1
21456	upon the name ('ourhanoz, orhatoz'). may i suppose that you have this	0
14102	all kinds, which are emblazoned on the walls of the city. the city has	0
17736	guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest	0
13358	connexion between them; and in his conception of the relation of ideas	0
16898	that also, he said, i understand; you mean, for example, as in tragedy.	0
20804	no, nor am i likely to hear.	0
4959	harry's insides went cold.  the dementors - tall, hooded creatures whose faces were concealed - were gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the room, each grasping one of the man's arms with their dead and rotten-looking hands.  the man between them looked as though he was about to faint, and harry couldn't blame him ... he knew the dementors could not touch him inside a memory, but he remembered their power only too well.  the watching crowd recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the man in the chained chair and glided back out of the room.  the door swung shut behind them.	1
22524	well, all that is very probable. but how is the image applicable to the	0
4968	dumbledore made a small noise of dissent through his long, crooked nose.	1
4150	then, quite suddenly, harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed over his mouth and nose. he tried to draw breath, but it made his head spin; his lungs were empty, and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck -	1
23168	every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk, and	0

5458	oh master . . . thank you, master ...	1
341	harry spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to his sides, blurred fireplaces flashing past him, until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes.  then, when at last he felt himself slowing down, he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the weasleys' kitchen fire.	1

2015	they scanned the darkening grounds excitedly, but nothing was moving; everything was still, silent, and quite as usual.  harry was starting to feel cold.  he wished they'd hurry up. .. . maybe the foreign students were preparing a dramatic entrance. . . . he remembered what mr. weasley had said back at the campsite before the quidditch world cup:  always the same - we can't resist showing off when we get together. ..	1
4221	come here, you, said madam pomfrey.  she seized harry and pulled him over to hermione and the others, wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket, and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat.  steam gushed out of his ears.	1

2971	harry, he said, very seriously, whoever put your name in that goblet - i - i reckon they're trying to do you in!	1
4755	hagrid was in such a bad mood, harry was quite glad to say good-bye to him in front of the fat lady.  he clambered through the portrait hole into the common room and hurried straight for the corner where ron and hermione were sitting, to tell them what had happened.	1
2182	thanks, hermione, said angelina, smiling at her.	1
9087	love of knowledge, no less than riches, may divert him? men of this	0
23823	then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son	0

5198	oi! ron called after her.  we've got our history of magic exam in ten minutes! blimey, he said, turning back to harry, she must really hate that skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam.  what're you going to do in binns's class - read again?	1

343	yeah, said harry, straightening up.  what was it?	1
5941	you are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being death eaters thirteen years ago!  said fudge angrily.  you could have found those names in old reports of the trials!  for heavens sake, dumbledore - the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too - his tales are getting taller, and you're still swallowing them - the boy can talk to snakes.  dumbledore, and you still think he's trustworthy?	1

7874	they are to be and not shopkeepers, the watchdogs and guardians of the	0
5210	cedric and his parents were just inside the door.  viktor krum was over in a corner, conversing with his dark-haired mother and father in rapid bulgarian.  he had inherited his fathers hooked nose.  on the other side of the room, fleur was jabbering away in french to her mother.  fleur's little sister, gabrielle, was holding her mother's hand.  she waved at harry, who waved back, grinning.  then he saw mrs. weasley and bill standing in front of the fireplace, beaming at him.	1

3742	have you heard anything about bertha jorkins? harry asked.	1
61	but you seem so much stronger, my lord --	1
18157	such cases are very common, he said, with invalids of this sort.	0
5398	harry felt his feet slam into the ground; his injured leg gave way, and he fell forward; his hand let go of the triwizard cup at last.  he raised his head.	1
7038	   'when workmen strive to do better than well,	0

32	on the landing, frank turned right, and saw at once where the intruders were:  at the every end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor.  frank edged closer and closer, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.	1
1769	reducio, moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its proper size.  he put it back into the jar.	1
16203	what do you mean? he said.	0
2140	back to the ship, then, he was saying. viktor, how are you feeling?  did you eat enough?  should i send for some mulled wine from the kitchens?	1

1056	of course - everyone knows - muttered mr. diggory, looking highly discomforted.	1

20810	then the world cannot possibly be a philosopher?	0

14787	yourself used the word 'interest' which you forbade me to use. it is	0
19649	interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?	0

136	mr. weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic, but he didn't have any particular expertise in the matter of curses, as far as harry knew.  in any case, harry didn't like the idea of the whole weasley family knowing that he, harry, was getting jumpy about a few moments' pain.  mrs. weasley would fuss worse than hermione, and fred and george, ron's sixteen- year-old twin brothers, might think harry was losing his nerve.  the weasleys were harry's favorite family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now (ron had mentioned something about the quidditch world cup), and he somehow didn't want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.	1
5898	where's dumbledore?  fudge demanded of mrs. weasley.	1
644	bagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been nothing.	1
16543	he who was present at the banquet, and who said this--he it is who has	0

1725	the gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to moody's first lesson so much that they arrived early on thursday lunchtime and queued up outside his classroom before the bell had even rung.  the only person missing was hermione, who turned up just in time for the lesson.	1
17328	and will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them?	0
12401	necessity. even if we cannot expect the mass of mankind to become	0
2705	shhh! said hagrid, and he knocked three times on the door bearing the crossed golden wands.	1
13175	for another in which education begins again. this is the continuous	0
21163	i knew that the perfect state would be eyed with jealousy and was	0
1356	well.. . making it look like he knows everything and we don't.. . . ron snarled. father's always associated with the top peopie at the ministry.'. . . dad could've got a promotion any time... he just likes it where he is. . . .	1
16154	yes, he said, the tools which would teach men their own use would be	0
16184	and also of the mental ones; his soul is to be full of spirit?	0
23227	spangled with the manners and characters of mankind, will appear to be	0
4062	easier ter spot than the adults, hagrid told the class.  they turn silver when they're abou' two years old, an' they grow horns at aroun four.  don' go pure white till they're full grown, 'round about seven.  they're a bit more trustin when they're babies .. . don mind boys so much.... c'mon, move in a bit, yeh can pat 'em if yeh want. . . give 'em a few o' these sugar lumps. . . .	1
16562	and can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle	0
5290	immediately, the world righted itself. harry fell forward onto his knees onto the wonderfully solid ground. he felt temporarily limp with shock. he took a deep, steadying breath, then got up again and hurried forward, looking back over his shoulder as he ran away from the golden mist, which twinkled innocently at him in the moonlight.	1
7477	not very different from saying that children must be taught through	0
8416	aristotle's conception of universal justice, virtue relative to others,	0
4037	oh ron, said hermione, shaking her head sceptically, we thought snape was trying to kill harry before, and it turned out he was saving harry's life, remember?	1
8386	although the third, temperance, has more of the nature of a harmony than	0
15184	those of which i was just now speaking.	0
4514	unwilling to go back to gryffindor tower and listen to ron and hermione snarling at each other, harry watched hagrid digging until the darkness swallowed him and the owls around harry began to awake, swooshing past him into the night.	1
14680	wild beast, seeking to devour us. we were quite panic-stricken at the	0
17557	question); for he is good who has a good soul. but the cunning and	0
6963	just is the skilled, and the unjust is the unskilled.	0
4458	you'd better get back to school, sirius said, getting to his feet.  now listen . . .  he looked particularly hard at harry.  i don't want you lot sneaking out of school to see me, all right?  just send notes to me here.  i still want to hear about anything odd.  but you're not to go leaving hogwarts without permission; it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you.	1
17011	but there is another sort of character who will narrate anything, and,	0
8883	the point:--the philosopher too is a lover of knowledge in every form;	0
20094	which i would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant;	0
20713	animal, when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or soil,	0

6256	a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of the sixteenth	0

4956	harry raised his right hand, hesitated, and then waved it energetically in from of dumbledore's face.  dumbledore did not blink, look around at harry, or indeed move at all. and that, in harry's opinion, settled the matter.  dumbledore wouldn't ignore him like that.  he was inside a memory, and this was not the present-day dumbledore.  yet it couldn't be that long ago . . . the dumbledore sitting next to him now was silver-haired, just like the present-day dumbledore.  but what was this place?  what were all these wizards waiting for?	1

2888	harry felt oddly separate from everyone around him, whether they were wishing him good luck or hissing we'll have a box of tissues ready, potter as he passed.  it was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he mightn't just lose his head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon, and start trying to curse everyone in sight.  time was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever, rushing past in great dollops, so that one moment he seemed to be sitting down in his first lesson, history of magic, and the next, walking into lunch.. . and then (where had the morning gone?  the last of the dragon-free hours?), professor mcgonagall was hurrying over to him in the great hall.  lots of people were watching.	1
24461	and the royal and orderly desires are nearest?	0
19814	animals, the presence of their young ones will be the greatest incentive	0
19809	and shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in	0

4879	nagini, said the cold voice, you are out of luck.  i will not be feeding wormtail to you, after all... but never mind, never mind . . . there is still harry potter. ...	1
22560	yes, he said, there is nothing which they like better.	0
15899	and is not a state larger than an individual?	0
3734	well, i just thought i'd congratulate you again on your splendid performance against that horntail, harry, said bagman. really superb.	1
16979	how can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds to	0

2930	he felt much more aware of his body than usual; very aware of the way his heart was pumping fast, and his fingers tingling with fear. . . yet at the same time, he seemed to be outside himself, seeing the walls of the tent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far away.	1
4950	breathing hard and fast.  harry looked around him.  not one of the witches and wizards in the room (and there were at least two hundred of them) was looking at him.  not one of them seemed to have noticed that a fourteen-year-old boy had just dropped from the ceiling into their midst.  harry turned to the wizard next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that reverberated around the silent room.	1

2703	but hagrid wasn't listening; he was opening the cabin door and striding off into the night.  harry hurried to follow and found, to his great surprise, that hagrid was leading him to the beauxbatons carriage.	1

17963	the process is as follows: when a potter becomes rich, will he, think	0
1506	what?  harry gasped.  he looked around at fred and george, his fellow members of the quidditch team. they were mouthing soundlessly at dumbledore, apparently too appalled to speak.  dumbhedore went on, this is due to an event that will be starting in october, and continuing throughout the school year, taking up much of the teachers' time and energy - but i am sure you will all enjoy it immensely. i have great pleasure in announcing that this year at hogwarts -	1

4194	the shark-man swam straight to hermione and began snapping and biting at her ropes; the trouble was that krum's new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dolphin, and harry was quite sure that if krum wasn't careful, he was going to rip hermione in half.  darting forward. harry hit krum hard on the shoulder and held up the jagged stone.  krum seized it and began to cut hermione free.  within seconds, he had done it; he grabbed hermione around the waist, and without a backward glance, began to rise rapidly with her toward the surface.	1
11605	qualities; and also mixed lives, made up of wealth and poverty,	0
11162	pleasure, honour, or advantage, the just man is right, and the unjust	0
1238	i'm never wearing them, ron was saying stubbornly. never.	1
2081	but there are only two extra people, harry said.  why's filch putting out four chairs, who else is coming?	1
4341	sirius was wearing ragged gray robes; the same ones he had been wearing when he had left azkaban.  his black hair was longer than it had been when he had appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and matted once more.  he looked very thin.	1
21421	the knower is what i would have you term the idea of good, and this	0
5176	very reluctantly, ron handed over the newspaper. harry turned it over and found himself staring at his own picture, beneath the banner headline:	1
13992	above the capacity and reach of man's wit, dispersed throughout all the	0
14007	day. his dislike of capital punishment, and plans for the reformation of	0
3511	ron didn't answer. he was glaring at hermione and krum, who were dancing nearby. padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed, one foot jiggling in time to the music.  every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at ron, who was completely ignoring her. parvati sat down on harry's other side, crossed her arms and legs too, and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from beauxbatons.	1
10955	and how does such an one live? 'nay, that you must tell me.' well then,	0
2625	i suppose i get my strength from my parents.  i know they'd be very proud of me if they could see me now. . . . yes, sometimes at night i still cry about them, i'm not ashamed to admit it. . . . i know nothing will hurt me during the tournament, because they're watching over me. . .	1
5188	how did she know your scar hurt in divination? ron said. there's no way she was there, there's no way she could've heard -	1
8233	manner is presented to us the famous question both of ancient and modern	0
3452	the common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black.  parvati was waiting for harry at the foot of the stairs.  she looked very pretty indeed, in robes of shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists.  harry was relieved to see that she wasn't giggling.	1

14656	then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts, and	0
1151	i've got to go, molly, said mr. weasley.  i've made things worse.  i'll just change into my robes and i'll be off. . . .	1

15117	ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?	0

3447	there was no christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at seven o'clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room. the fat lady was sitting in her frame with her friend violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom other picture.	1
1125	harry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing. he knew he ought to feel exhausted: it was nearly three in the morning, but he felt wide-awake - wide-awake, and worried.	1
8850	of being one family--fathers, brothers, mothers, daughters, going out	0
25863	1.e.7.  do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,	0
3614	i don't know who maxime thinks she's kidding, harry said, watching madame maxime sitting alone at the judges' table, looking very somber.  if hagrid's half-giant, she definitely is.  big bones . .. the only thing that's got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur.	1
8308	feet high because he is told so, and having nothing to measure with	0
4154	the water didn't feel icy anymore either ... on the contrary, he felt pleasantly cool and very light. . . . harry struck out once more, marveling at how far and fast his flipper-like feet propelled him through the vater, and noticing how clearly he could see, and how he no longer seemed to need to blink.  he had soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom. he flipped over and dived into its depths.	1
20970	at present, i said, the students of philosophy are quite young;	0
21725	to them at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision	0
20868	and so philosophy is left desolate, with her marriage rite incomplete:	0
23029	be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities are	0
7024	doing as well as making. another flaw or inaccuracy of language may be	0
21487	i do not quite understand your meaning, he said.	0

1615	you are preoccupied, my dear, she said mournfully to harry.  my inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within.  and i regret to say that your worries are not baseless.  i see difficult times ahead for you, alas. . . most difficult.. . i fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass. . . and perhaps sooner than you think...	1
7180	good and evil, and the motives of actions and the origin of institutions	0
10920	respective ages of parents, i.e. on other numbers.	0
9194	and yet these opposite elements are all necessary, and therefore, as	0
8796	but is such a community possible?--as among the animals, so also among	0

5422	but wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes, did not reply; he was busy checking the tightness of the cords, his fingers trembling uncontrollably, rumbling over the knots. once sure that harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn't move an inch, wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into harry's mouth; then, without a word, he turned from harry and hurried away. harry couldn't make a sound, nor could he see where wormtail had gone; he couldn't turn his head to see beyond the headstone; he could see only what was right in front of him.	1

3888	oooh, very good, she said, her thick glasses twinkling, it took diggory much longer than that!  and that was with her awake too - myrtle jerked her head toward the mermaid with an expression of great dislike on her glum face - giggling and showing off and flashing her fins.. ..	1

3199	potter!  weasley!  will you pay attention?	1
10228	namely, the sending out of the city all who had arrived at ten years of	0
6327	democracy, and democracy into tyranny, in an imaginary but regular order	0
25228	has implanted in us, and therefore we would have her appear at her best	0
16732	what would you say again to the tale of zeus, who, while other gods and	0
7492	whether his religion was an historical fact. he was just beginning to be	0
17412	hero eurypylus, after he has been wounded in homer, drinks a posset of	0
18095	contracts between man and man, and from contracts goes on to laws and	0
18080	kind of song; and this ought not to be praised, or conceived to be the	0
18427	the time then has arrived, glaucon, when, like huntsmen, we should	0
12151	hippias to hear his recitals of homer; but in this they resembled the	0
1668	leave - what? harry said, bewildered.	1
3012	there's no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous, how could they be?  ron went on as he carried pigwidgeon to the window.  you know what? i reckon you could win this tournament, harry, i'm serious.	1
1860	spew?  said harry, picking up a badge and looking at it. what's this about?	1
479	yes, well, he passed the second time, said mrs. weasley, marching back into the kitchen amid hearty sniggers.	1
22339	as being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion. and as	0
3347	because - oh shut up laughing, you two - because they've both just been turned down by girls they asked to the ball!  said ginny.	1
24828	and so, when we hear persons saying that the tragedians, and homer, who	0
2067	d'you think he'd sign my hat in lipstick?	1
22704	then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures, being	0
2564	how do you think they'd feel if they knew you were competing in the triwizard tournament?  proud?  worried?  angry?	1
9787	as any one who is the least of a mathematician is aware, is mean and	0
12835	individuality. but we can hardly condemn too strongly a system which,	0
8028	to time in favour of merit. he is aware how deeply the greater part of	0
25146	which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person?	0
25524	described. he mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits	0
9152	if they are gently entreated, and are taught the true nature of the	0
14683	possession of you all? and why, sillybillies, do you knock under to	0
25241	under the excitement of poetry, he neglect justice and virtue?	0
4227	dumbledore was crouching at the water's edge, deep in conversation with what seemed to be the chief merperson, a particularly wild and ferocious-looking female.  he was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople made when they were above water; clearly, dumbledore could speak mermish.  finally he straightened up, turned to his fellow judges, and said, a conference before we give the marks, i think.	1
21357	perceive the other objects of sense?	0
11349	you have ever done to mankind? is there any city which professes to have	0
12139	after gold and silver.' though not in the strict sense communists, the	0

16326	father when he does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be following	0

19234	to different natures and the same to the same natures.	0
3277	want to come to the ball with me?	1
2530	her hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that contrasted oddly with her heavy-jawed face.  she wore jeweled spectacles.  the thick fingers clutching her crocodile-skin handbag ended in two-inch nails, painted crimson.	1
13390	education. although plato could tell us nothing, and perhaps knew that	0
10035	figure in themselves. he too will be apt to depreciate their application	0
19970	consider then, i said, when that which we have acknowledged to be	0
730	winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her face was half-hidden again.	1
8968	in the history of philosophy. he did not remark that the degrees of	0
11876	commonly called love, has hitherto been the inspiring influence of	0
12726	a platonic formula, are not ignorant of the dissatisfactions and	0
9717	upon him, and he must no longer live in the heaven of ideas. and this	0
13413	and may be described as the soul conversing with herself or holding	0
25515	length of man's life, and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a	0
558	a twenty, harry corrected him in an undertone, uncomfortably aware of mr. roberts trying to catch every word.	1
14060	yet able to find out the second intentions; insomuch that none of them	0
18537	larger example appeared to be the state, and accordingly we constructed	0
18330	of every other opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture	0
24517	injustice, let us have a little conversation with him.	0
13044	a repose in a divine perfection, which, whether in a more personal or	0
3102	yeah, thanks! ron shouted over his shoulder.	1
8735	that none of them recognise their own offspring; and if necessary other	0
7714	the law of simplicity. he who violates it cannot be allowed to work in	0
7439	retailers sit in the market-place to save the time of the producers.	0
25599	order; then he took from the knees of lachesis lots and samples of	0
24856	asclepiads were, or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts	0
2004	the heads of houses were ordering their students into lines.	1
1943	hagrid's smile faded off his face.	1
117	harry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes, and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there.  as it happened, there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room.  a large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron, broomstick, black robes, and assorted spellbooks.  rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which his snowy owl, hedwig, usually perched.  on the floor beside his bed a book lay open; harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night.  the pictures in this book were all moving.  men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another.	1
25876	     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax	0
6711	enlarged by the genius of plato into the form of an allegory or parable,	0
2125	filch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the hall, now approached dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels. it looked extremely old. a murmur of excited interest rose from the watching students; dennis creevey actually stood on his chair to see it properly, but, being so tiny, his head hardly rose above anyone else's.	1
18100	then, as i was saying, our youth should be trained from the first in	0
5252	feeling all right. harry? bagman asked as they went down the stone steps onto the grounds.  confident?	1
3538	i'd never help him work out that egg! said hermione, looking outraged. never.  how could you say something like that - i want harry to win the tournament.  harry knows that, don't you, harry?	1
9803	would you prefer to look to yourself only? 'every man is his own best	0
22063	and ridiculous manner, of squaring and extending and applying and the	0
6988	kindness has supplied me, now that you have left off scolding. and yet	0
3561	i hope my brothers weren't bothering you, mr. bagman? said percy at once.	1
3745	bagman seemed to know he wasn't being honest.	1
20848	they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping to reap	0
12051	of the heavenly bodies with the mythological image of the web, or	0
6126	so, said malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them, a smirk quivering on his lips.  you caught some pathetic reporter, and potter's dumbledore's favorite boy again.  big deal.	1
15352	wherever she takes up her abode, whether in a city, in an army, in a	0
7510	in placing the moral before the historical truth of religion; and,	0
8639	destroy my friends as well as myself. not that i mind a little innocent	0
18642	again willing and wishing,--all these you would refer to the classes	0
4543	hang on, said hagrid, looking down into the crate, there's a spare niffler here . . . who's missin?  where's hermione?	1
8272	the happiness of mankind? yet here too we may observe that what we term	0
15225	we may put the matter thus, i said--the just does not desire more than	0
741	hermione, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through her velvetcovered, tasseled program.	1
14887	you are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money? and remember	0
3762	he shouldn't be doing that! said hermione, looking very shocked.  he's one of the judges!  and anyway, you've already worked it out - haven't you?	1
748	harry, ron, and hermione turned quickly.  edging along the second row to three still-empty seats right behind mr. weasley were none other than dobby the house-elf's former owners: lucius malfoy; his son, draco; and a woman harry supposed must be draco's mother.	1
24774	ideal bed and not the two others.	0
12446	be the same violation of the common hellenic sentiment, as the community	0
122	harry listened closely to the silence around him.  was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak?  and then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room.	1
11493	that which is immortal must be of the fairest and simplest composition.	0
14309	then we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.	0
4627	what're we going this way for? said harry as they passed hagrid s cabin and the illuminated beauxbatons carriage.	1
19581	shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought	0
10650	of the sicilian states, which alternated between democracy and tyranny,	0
4436	i dunno - maybe he thought dumbledore would kick him out-	1
24653	as he deems likely to make him a better man; but those, whether private	0
2995	what? ron bellowed furiously. four?  you lousy, biased scum-bag, you gave krum ten!	1
22356	faltering at any step of the argument--unless he can do all this, you	0
10798	figure. (greek) is the 'base' on which the whole calculation depends,	0
22515	in need, or to do or say anything against them; and he will be less	0
25946	provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.	0
6754	to a small party, consisting of critias, timaeus, hermocrates, and	0
2009	nearly six, said ron, checking his watch and then staring down the drive that led to the front gates.  how d'you reckon they're coming?  the train?	1
23678	satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?	0
16523	then no motive can be imagined why god should lie?	0
2019	something large, much larger than a broomstick - or, indeed, a hundred broomsticks - was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle, growing larger all the time.	1
10068	power of attention, developes the sense of order and the faculty of	0
20960	the ruin of the state: all great attempts are attended with risk; 'hard	0
16449	then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many	0
6390	the republic may only arise out of the discordant elements which the	0
10448	pleasure. as in the state, so in the individual, there are allies on	0
18200	remains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of	0
2013	a portkey? ron suggested.  or they could apparate - maybe you're allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come from?	1
9874	paths which lead thither?' dear glaucon, you cannot follow me here.	0
12697	with regret to the past, we should look forward with hope to the future.	0
10976	become the mercenaries of a tyrant. but in time of peace they stay	0
5457	hold out your arm, said voldemort lazily.	1
17620	and the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?	0
21107	as rushing at us with might and main, that the painter of constitutions	0
24322	there are many of them: take as an example the pleasures of smell, which	0
5186	gone off me a bit, hasn't she?  said harry lightly, folding up the paper.	1
3885	trying not to think about moaning myrtle zooming down a pipe to the lake with the contents of a toilet.  harry said, well, does anything in there have a human voice?  hang on -	1
17580	and thus our youth, having been educated only in that simple music	0
7100	appearance as the true reality! his high character makes him a ruler;	0
18567	very true, i said; and i do not think that the method which we are	0
9094	suitor. for philosophy, even in her fallen estate, has a dignity of her	0
15903	nature of justice and injustice, first as they appear in the state, and	0
12228	of magna graecia. there was much here that was suggestive to the kindred	0
7378	sort which is comprehended under the name of music and gymnastic? music	0
10497	she-dogs are as good as their she-mistresses, and horses and asses march	0
10233	book viii. and so we have arrived at the conclusion, that in the perfect	0
14806	when they are mistaken, contrary to their interest; you admit that?	0
15240	clearly the musician is wise, and he who is not a musician is foolish.	0
4042	you just don't like crouch because of that elf, winky, said ron, sending a cushion soaring into the window.	1
10807	are those which are exceeded by the sum of their divisors: e.g. 12	0
18592	whole soul comes into play in each sort of action--to determine that is	0
15202	i may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you?--to refute the	0
12335	other mode of vesting property which was found to be more advantageous,	0
13148	still, through this fallacious medium, a real enlargement of ideas is	0
24229	again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the	0
7158	dispensation, the honours and profits of justice. had we been taught in	0
5780	we went back to the tent, said crouch.  then we heard them.  we heard the death eaters.  the ones who had never been to azkaban.  the ones who had never suffered for my master.  they had turned their backs on him.  they were not enslaved, as i was.  they were free to seek him, but they did not.  they were merely making sport of muggles.  the sound of their voices awoke me.  my mind was clearer than it had been in years.  i was angry.  i had the wand.	1
7466	retail trade, etc., then we should knew how pleasant and agreeable all	0
18527	auxiliary, and the guardian each do their own business, that is justice,	0
25476	unjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the	0
10846	squaring and then cubing obtain two expressions, which denote the ratio	0
11032	a swarm of passions which he cannot indulge; living indoors always like	0
11598	mortal life has begun, and you may choose what divinity you please;	0
22286	world--this power is given, as i was saying, by all that study and	0
1478	you're lucky there's a feast at all tonight, you know, said nearly headless nick. there was trouble in the kitchens earlier.	1
538	it happened immediately:  harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward.  his feet left the ground; he could feel ron and hermione on either side of him, their shoulders banging into his; they were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color; his forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then -	1
526	ced's talked about you, of course, said amos diggory.  told us all about playing against you last year... i said to him, i said - ced, that'll be something to tell your grandchildren, that will.... you beat harry potter!	1
18519	seeing then, i said, that there are three distinct classes, any meddling	0
4313	do you know what this is. potter? snape said, his eyes glittering dangerously again.	1
5866	at this point.  harry found he could not continue.  he looked around at sirius and saw that he had his face in his hands.	1
9718	will be the salvation of the state. for those who rule must not be those	0
24718	wait a little, and there will be more reason for your saying so. for	0
15504	because i want to know in which of the three classes you would place	0
2797	harry got up on sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock.  when he'd finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body, he hurried off to find hermione, locating her at the gryffindor table in the great hall, where she was eating breakfast with ginny.  feeling too queasy to eat, harry waited until hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge, then dragged her out onto the grounds.  there, he told her all about the dragons, and about everything sirius had said, while they took another long walk around the lake.	1
12330	we can hardly judge what effect plato's views would have upon his	0
17102	the ionian, he replied, and the lydian; they are termed 'relaxed.'	0
16980	the callings of any of these?	0
18174	yes, he said; the states are as bad as the men; and i am very far from	0
10412	when the poor are the victors, killing some and exiling some, and giving	0
17928	which will make them anything but guardians; for we too can clothe our	0
12769	wickedest and worst. not by the platonic device of uniting the strong	0
25309	consider, i said, glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether	0
4574	hate mail continued to arrive for hermione over the following week, and although she followed hagrid's advice and stopped opening it, several of her ill-wishers sent howlers, which exploded at the gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the whole hall to hear.  even those people who didn't read witch weekly knew all about the supposed harry-krum-hermione triangle now.  harry was getting sick of telling people that hermione wasn't his girlfriend.	1
24662	in heaven, i replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks, which	0
10576	smoke into the fire. thus liberty, when out of all order and reason,	0
196	uncle vernon was perusing the letter again.	1
15639	death; being just and seeming to be unjust. when both have reached the	0
391	the room at the top of the house where ron slept looked much as it had the last time that harry had come to stay: the same posters of ron's favorite quidditch team, the chudley cannons, were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the fish tank on the windowsill, which had previously held frog spawn, now contained one extremely large frog. ron's old rat, scabbers, was here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered ron's letter to harry in privet drive.  it was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madly.	1
4430	yeah, it does!  said ron excitedly, but sirius shook his head.	1
11576	like a number of boxes fitting into one another with their edges	0
21233	yes, i said; and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the	0
13623	by a fiction to the original legislator; and the words of such	0
2804	he returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks, set them down, and began to flick through each in turn, hermione whispering nonstop at his elbow.	1

4027	and moody thought he. harry, ought to be an auror!  interesting idea.. . but somehow. harry thought, as he got quietly into his four-poster ten minutes later, the egg and the cloak now safely back in his trunk, he thought he'd like to check how scarred the rest of them were before he chose it as a career.	1

15861	hearing these words i was quite delighted, and said: sons of an	0
12351	have disappeared? this was a distinction familiar to aristotle, though	0
11233	in plato and aristotle we note the illusion under which the ancients	0
25800	works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg	0

1942	i will not, said draco malfoy flatly when hagrid had proposed this with the air of father christmas pulling an extra-large toy out of his sack.  i see enough of these foul things during lessons, thanks.	1
2549	i didn't, said harry.  i don't know how my name got into the goblet of fire.  i didn't put it in there.	1
2686	harry stared at him in amazement.  the large chunk missing from moody's nose was particularly obvious at a few inches' distance.  moody grinned.	1

3087	yes, said professor trelawney, nodding impressively, it comes, ever closer, it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower. . . ever lower over the castle. . . .	1

1908	she nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have done, but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same.  then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise.  harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach.  he had been so sure that sirius's reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them.	1
4562	the gold i gave you at the quidditch world cup, said ron.  the leprechaun gold i gave you for my omnioculars.  in the top box.  why didn't you tell me it disappeared?	1

5844	harry looked up at dumbledore again, on whose face there was an arrested look.	1
25718	by the river of unmindfulness, whose water no vessel can hold; of this	0
19437	an orderly fashion; in a city of the blessed, licentiousness is an	0
24035	gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and remorse?	0
2183	yeah, better you than pretty-boy diggory, said seamus, causing several hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him.	1
9750	two objects to be relatively great and small, these ideas of greatness	0
8619	states, when polemarchus--he was sitting a little farther from me	0

23805	and now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic	0
14910	medicine, as you will acknowledge. am i not right?	0
942	harry looked around. i reckon we can just wait here, you know.  we'll hear anyone coming a mile off.	1
13506	it may have a great effect in elevating the characters of mankind,	0
20303	and not-being is not one thing but, properly speaking, nothing?	0

1114	there was silence for a moment. then bill, removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut, said, well, it didn't help us tonight, whoever conjured it.  it scared the death eaters away the moment they saw it.  they all disapparated before we'd got near enough to unmask any of them.  we caught the robertses before they hit the ground, though.  they're having their memories modified right now.	1
13093	'they have seen bad imitations of the philosopher-statesman.' but a man	0
1231	i'll go starkers before i put that on, said ron stubbornly.	1
12585	upon the physical? the higher comes first, then the lower, first the	0

11331	although he knows nothing of their arts; and this with sufficient skill	0

3501	harry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up.  the weird sisters struck up a slow, mournful tune; harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor, carefully avoiding catching anyone's eye (he could see seamus and dean waving at him and sniggering), and next moment, parvati had seized his hands, placed one around her waist, and was holding the other tightly in hers.	1
1758	 yes? said moody, his magical eye rolling right over to fix on neville.	1
19497	we shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less	0

25099	and the other principle, which inclines us to recollection of our	0
6786	answers that when you are old the belief in the world below grows upon	0
9692	according to the direction given. did you never observe how the mind of	0
6133	malfoy, crabbe, and goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway.  he, ron, and hermione were on their feet, all three of them having used a different hex.  nor were they the only ones to have done so.	1
19131	but can you use different animals for the same purpose, unless they are	0
11099	ignorance of the true upper, middle, and lower regions. and a like	0

9176	surely in the course of ages there might be one exception--and one	0
4601	so at half past eight that night. harry left ron and hermione in gryffindor tower and went downstairs.  as he crossed the entrance hall, cedric came up from the hufflepuff common room.	1

22861	such a person is apt to be rough with slaves, unlike the educated man,	0
5933	fudge had taken half a step back from dumbledore, but he looked no less stubborn.	1
22670	your recollection, i said, is most exact.	0
20950	yes, i replied, ours in most respects; but you may remember my saying	0
22763	10,000. the whole number will then be 17,500 = a square of 100, and an	0
3137	how long have you been here, dobby?  harry asked as dobby handed around the tea.	1
10466	is the process by which the youth passes from the necessary pleasures to	0

23639	making promises in public and also in private! liberating debtors, and	0
9851	conception. 'that last,' he said, 'must be a marvellous thing.' a thing,	0
3399	hermione, said ron, looking sideways at her, suddenly frowning, your teeth ...	1
15046	good, but like a mere diner or banquetter with a view to the pleasures	0
2593	hmm, said mr. olhivander, this is a gregorovitch creation, unless i'm much mistaken?  a fine wand-maker, though the styling is never quite what i. . . however. .	1

1601	harry and ron grinned at hagrid, who gave them a furtive smile from behind his bushy beard. hagrid would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon, as harry, ron, and hermione knew only too well - he had owned one for a brief period during their first year, a vicious norwegian ridgeback by the name of norbert.  hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures, the more lethal, the better.	1

4540	one of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite pansy parkinson's watch off her wrist. she shrieked and jumped backward.	1
6011	there was a loud slamming noise, and mrs. weasley and harry broke apart.  hermione was standing by the window.  she was holding something tight in her hand.	1
6915	stronger; and (2) that injustice is more profitable and also stronger	0
6006	the thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come out of the maze was threatening to overpower him.  he could feel a burning, prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes.  he blinked and stared up at the ceiling.	1
2181	well, i'm glad someone from gryffindor's entering, said hermione. i really hope you get it, angelina!	1

5896	harry heard the hospital doors burst open.  unnoticed by any of the people around his bed, all of whom were staring at the door as bill pulled back the screens, harry sat up and put his glasses back on.	1
16757	should not lay aside his anger. neither will we believe or acknowledge	0
163	harry heard talking at the door, and someone laughing, and uncle vernon answering curtly.  then the front door closed, and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall.	1
19371	and he himself is ignorant of what he is laughing at, or what he is	0
17000	some good action; at other times he will be ashamed to play a part which	0
7950	language; a want of plato's 'art of measuring' is the rule cause of the	0
2323	an extremely tense silence followed these words. ludo bagman, who was looking very anxious indeed, bounced nervously up and down on his feet and said, moody, old man. . . what a thing to say!	1
6628	to be attacked by his brother adeimantus. he is a soldier, and, like	0
18982	gods and men, or to be unjust and act unjustly, if only unpunished and	0
6697	answer to a question more fluently than another.	0

4096	he imagined himself explaining that he couldn't do the task.  he pictured bagman's look of round-eyed surprise, karkaroffs satisfied, yellow-toothed smile.  he could almost hear fleur delacour saying i knew it. . . 'e is too young, 'e is only a little boy.  he saw malfoy flashing his potter stinks badge at the front of the crowd, saw hagrid s crestfallen, disbelieving face. . . .	1

9765	example of this is afforded by any object of sight. all number has also	0
12814	what plato had heard or seen of sparta was applied by him in a mistaken	0

'never be ashamed,' my ol' dad used ter say, 'there's some who'll hold it against you, but they're not worth botherin' with.' an' he was right.  i've bin an idiot.  i'm not botherin' with her no more, i promise yeh that.  big bones . . . i'll give her big bones.	1
14433	even to this are there not exceptions? suppose that a friend when in his	0
23369	they call silliness, is ignominiously thrust into exile by them, and	0

16676	that of homer when he describes how	0

1087	hermione, i agree with you, said mr. weasley quickly, beckoning her on, but now is not the time to discuss elf rights.  i want to get back to the tent as fast as we can. what happened to the others?	1
20466	and is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth?	0
15132	a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling	0
3410	everyone in the common room was much too busy in letting off more holiday steam to observe what anyone else was up to.  ron, harry, and hermione sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually filling up with snow, and harry read out:	1

15578	according to custom, that they might send their monthly report about the	0
5600	as the closest bead of light moved nearer to harrys wand tip, the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame.  the closer that bead moved, the harder harry's wand vibrated; he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it; it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers -	1
6594	argument. nothing is more amusing than his complete submission when	0
16922	already laid down that one man can only do one thing well, and not many;	0
17161	then, i said, we must take damon into our counsels; and he will tell us	0
5278	there was a loud crack, and the shape-shifter exploded in a wisp of smoke.  the silver stag faded from sight.  harry wished it could have stayed, he could have used some company...but he moved on, quickly and quietly as possible, listening hard, his wand held high once more.	1

2999	fleur, cedric, and krum all came in together.  one side of cedric's face was covered in a thick orange paste, which was presumably mending his burn.  he grinned at harry when he saw him.	1

1874	there was a pause in which hermione beamed at the pair of them, and harry sat, torn between exasperation at hermione and amusement at the look on ron's face.  the silence was broken, not by ron, who in any case looked as though he was temporarily dumbstruck, but by a soft tap, tap on the window.  harry looked across the now empty common room and saw, illuminated by the moonlight, a snowy owl perched on the windowsill.	1
21397	then the sun is not sight, but the author of sight who is recognised by	0
23921	evil nature in himself. have we not here a picture of his way of life?	0

10793	the terms used in the statement of the problem may be explained as	0

1320	there's traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools.  durmstrang and beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets, said hermione matter-of-factly.	1

4207	the crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise; shouting and screaming, they all seemed to be on their feet; harry had the impression they thought that ron and the little girl might be dead, but they were wrong . . . both of them had opened their eyes; the girl looked scared and confused, but ron merely expelled a great spout of water, blinked in the bright light, turned to harry, and said, wet, this, isn't it?  then he spotted fleur's sister.  what did you bring her for?	1
5274	he shook his head and dived out of sight, along another path.  keen to put plenty of distance between himself and the skrewts, harry hurried off again.  then, as he turned a corner, he saw ... a dementor gliding toward him.  twelve feet tall, its face hidden by its hood, its rotting, scabbed hands outstretched, it advanced, sensing its way blindly toward him.  harry could hear its rattling breath; he felt clammy coldness stealing over him, but knew what he had to do....	1

107	and then the chair was facing frank, and he saw what was sitting in it.  his walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter.  he opened his mouth and let out a scream.  he was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand.  there was a flash of green light, a rushing sound, and frank bryce crumpled.  he was dead before he hit the floor.	1

24695	very true, he said; but in your presence, even if i had any faint	0

5304	the air was suddenly full of cedric's yells.  horrified, harry began sprinting up his path, trying to find a way into cedric's.  when none appeared, he tried the reductor curse again.  it wasn't very effective, but it burned a small hole in the hedge through which harry forced his leg, kicking at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and made an opening; he struggled through it, tearing his robes, and looking to his right, saw cedric jerking and twitching on the ground, krum standing over him.	1

4565	they climbed the steps into the entrance hall and went into the great hall for lunch.	1

2450	crabbe and goyle guffawed sycophantically, but malfoy had to stop there, because hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower of crates, each containing a very large blast-ended skrewt.  to the class's horror, hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk.  the only good thing about this plan was that it distracted malfoy completely.	1

953	not exactly on top of things, mr. bagman, is he? said hermione, frowning.	1
23364	sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him, the aforesaid vain	0
853	vell, ve fought bravely, said a gloomy voice behind harry.  he looked around; it was the bulgarian minister of magic.	1

8260	conscience of mankind. it is associated too much with the comforts and	0
20532	they are absolutely necessary, he replied.	0
3457	okay, said harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room.  fred winked at harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole.	1
346	how're you doing, harry? said the nearer of the two, grinning at him and holding out a large hand, which harry shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers.  this had to be charlie, who worked with dragons in romania.  charlie was built like the twins, shorter and stockier than percy and ron, who were both long and lanky.  he had a broad, good-natured face, which was weather-beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his arms were muscular, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it.	1
21206	probation which we did not mention--he must be exercised also in many	0

11333	us and told us, how he had met a man who knew all that everybody knows,	0
1173	good thinking! said ron, his expression clearing. i bet sirius'll know what to do!	1
3280	there you go, said fred to harry and ron, piece of cake.	1
15945	into a common stock?--the individual husbandman, for example, producing	0
23989	only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him; but let us	0
4877	you are in luck, wormtail, said a cold, high-pitched voice from the depths of the chair in which the owl had landed.  you are very fortunate indeed.  your blunder has not ruined everything.  he is dead.	1
3971	snape stretched out his hands like a blind man and began to move up the stairs; harry could have sworn his over-large nostrils were dilating, trying to sniff harry out - trapped. harry leaned backward, trying to avoid snapes fingertips, but any moment now-	1
25465	were saying. and you may suppose that i have repeated the remainder of	0
7610	in self-control and obedience to authority. that is a lesson which homer	0
4109	harry opened his eyes.  he was still in the library; the invisibility cloak had slipped off his head as he'd slept, and the side of his face was stuck to the pages of where there's a wand, there's a way.  he sat up, straightening his glasses, blinking in the bright daylight.	1
19134	then, if women are to have the same duties as men, they must have the	0
1535	dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to mad-eye moody.  there was a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet and swarmed toward the double doors into the entrance hall.	1
17323	yes, he said; that a guardian should require another guardian to take	0
13674	the republic of a poem; the one is more religious, the other more	0
21861	and which every one first has to learn among the elements of education.	0
3202	now that potter and weasley have been kind enough to act their age, said professor mcgonagall, with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of harry's haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor - ron's parrot's beak had severed it moments before - i have something to say to you all.	1
24525	there are said of have been such unions.	0

8254	our neighbours and of all men everywhere. by the modern founder of	0

13652	by the analogy of history. the narrowness of view, which to ourselves	0
22072	then, my noble friend, geometry will draw the soul towards truth,	0
20942	of philosophy, instead of persisting, degenerates and receives another	0
19985	and any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them as	0
19667	these, he said, and none other; for what can be more ridiculous than for	0
24141	that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable, and that	0
19529	about twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?	0
11586	circles were moving in the opposite, with various degrees of swiftness	0
13310	or strength of the citizens; or that the duty of taking care of the	0
24271	only; and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of	0
12723	part of his nature; we regard him as a creature having many sides, or	0
2767	we know he's a good actor, said sirius, because he convinced the ministry of magic to set him free, didn't he?  now, i've been keeping an eye on the daily prophet, harry..	1

20995	more earnest in their opposition to you, and will never be convinced;	0
1122	use your brains, ron, said bill. if they really were death eaters, they worked very hard to keep out of azkaban when you-know-who lost power, and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people.  i bet they'd be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back.  they denied they'd ever been involved with him when he lost his powers, and went back to their daily lives. . . . i don't reckon he'd be over-pleased with them, do you?	1
26012	against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who	0
2107	she's a veela!  he said hoarsely to harry.	1
3005	congratulations, harry!  she said, beaming at him.  i wonder if you could give me a quick word?  how you felt facing that dragon?  how you feel now, about the fairness of the scoring?	1
23465	i mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his	0
17652	the weapon of persuasion,--he is like a wild beast, all violence and	0

2286	madame maxime!  said fleur at once, striding over to her headmistress.  zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!	1
5824	dumbledore began to tell sirius everything barty crouch had said.  harry was only half listening.  so tired every bone in his body was aching, he wanted nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours and hours, until he fell asleep and didn't have to think or feel anymore.	1

1966	the appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon the inhabitants of the castle.  during the following week, there seemed to be only one topic of conversation, no matter where harry went:  the triwizard tournament. rumors were flying from student to student like highly contagious germs:  who was going to try for hogwarts champion, what the tournament would involve, how the students from beauxbatons and durmstrang differed from themselves.	1

4426	moody says crouch is obsessed with catching dark wizards, harry told sirius.	1
4331	we can talk later, karkaroff!  spat snape.  potter!  what are you doing?	1

3796	my parents don't read the daily prophet.  she can't scare me into hiding!  said hermione, now striding along so fast that it was all harry and ron could do to keep up with her.  the last time harry had seen hermione in a rage like this, she had hit draco malfoy around the face.  and hagrid isn't hiding anymore!  he should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him!  come on!	1
4469	harry, ron, and hermione went up to the owlery after breakfast on sunday to send a letter to percy, asking, as sirius had suggested, whether he had seen mr. crouch lately.  they used hedwig, because it had been so long since she'd had a job.  when they had watched her fly out of sight through the owlery window, they proceeded down to the kitchen to give dobby his new socks.	1

2445	if harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of him being champion, the following day showed him how mistaken he was.  he could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessons - and it was clear that the rest of the school, just like the gryffindors, thought harry had entered himself for the tournament.  unlike the gryffindors, however, they did not seem impressed.	1

2238	the halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual.  perhaps because it was their second feast in two days, harry didn't seem to fancy the extravagantly prepared food as much as he would have normally.  like everyone else in the hall, judging by the constantly craning necks, the impatient expressions on every face, the fidgeting, and the standing up to see whether dumbledore had finished eating yet, harry simply wanted the plates to clear, and to hear who had been selected as champions.	1

5960	it seemed fudge could think of no answer to this.  he rocked backward and forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands.  finally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, he can't be back, dumbledore, he just can't be ...	1

507	they didn't have breath to spare for talking as they began to climb stoatshead hill, stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit holes, slipping on thick black tuffets of grass.  each breath harry took was sharp in his chest and his legs were starting to seize up when, at last, his feet found level ground.	1

12993	the discovery of a great metaphysical conception seems to ravish the	0
8595	method of developing the parts out of the whole; or he might have asked	0
150	yes, thought harry, that looked all right.  there was no point putting in the dream; he didn't want it to look as though he was too worried.  he folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk, ready for when hedwig returned.  then he got to his feet, stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more. without glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast.	1
826	the leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field. at this, the veela lost control.  instead of dancing, they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns.  watching through his omnioculars, harry saw that they didn't look remotely beautiful now.  on the contrary, their faces were elongating into sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders -	1

16186	but are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another,	0

1866	and you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying 'spew,' do you? said ron.	1
5687	there's a death eater at hogwarts!  there's a death eater here - they put my name in the goblet of fire, they made sure i got through to the end -	1

8248	we infer the one from the other. and the greatest happiness of the	0
4094	crookshanks crawled into harrys lap and curled up, purring deeply.  the common room emptied slowly around harry.  people kept wishing him luck for the next morning in cheery, confident voices like hagrid s, all of them apparently convinced that he was about to pull off another stunning performance like the one he had managed in the first task.  harry couldn't answer them, he just nodded, feeling as though there were a golfball stuck in his throat. by ten to midnight, he was alone in the room with crookshanks.  he had searched all the remaining books, and ron and hermione had not come back.	1
19718	yes; and there is a further good in the law; viz. that if a man has a	0

22918	next, let us look at another man who, as aeschylus says,	0
5887	harry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn't open his eyes, wanting to drop off again.  the room was still dimly lit; he was sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that he couldn't have been asleep very long.	1
4678	just keep him here, said harry, pulling himself free of mr. crouch.  i'll be back with dumbledore.	1
22008	the argument. you know how steadily the masters of the art repel and	0
15787	and believe both or neither. if the poets speak truly, why then we had	0

1364	oooh, i wouldn't fancy crossing the lake in this weather, said hermione fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the rest of the crowd. a hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them outside the station.  harry, ron, hermione, and neville climbed gratefully into one of them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great lurch, the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the track toward hogwarts castle.	1

3226	why do they have to move in packs?  harry asked ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them, sniggering and staring at harry.  how're you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?	1
20001	i agree, he said, that our citizens should thus deal with their hellenic	0
21803	indeed, i do not, he said.	0
4066	harry, said hagrid, clapping a massive hand on his shoulder, so that harry's knees buckled under its weight, i'd've bin worried before i saw yeh take on tha horntail, but i know now yeh can do anythin' yeh set yer mind ter.  i'm not worried at all.  yeh're goin ter be fine. got yer clue worked out, haven' yeh?	1
2401	yeah, okay, said ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as cedric.  only you said this morning you'd have done it last night, and no one would've seen you.. . . i'm not stupid, you know.	1
12777	the general condition of mankind into which we are born. nothing is	0
23342	and there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the	0
18582	of the love of knowledge, which is the special characteristic of our	0
14125	fall under the 'tyranny' of idolatry.	0

14905	i mean what i may illustrate negatively by the example of the body.	0

25734	thus shall we live dear to one another and to the gods, both while	0
2700	what're you showing me? harry said warily, wondering if the skrewts had laid eggs, or hagrid had managed to buy another giant three-headed dog off a stranger in a pub.	1
116	and who had the old man been?  for there had definitely been an old man; harry had watched him fall to the ground.  it was all becoming confused.  harry put his face into his hands, blocking out his bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands; the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them...voldemort and wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed, though harry could not remember the name...and they had been plotting to kill someone else...him!	1
2030	dumbly-dort, said madame maxime in a deep voice. i 'ope i find you well?	1
20310	and can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?	0
6687	which there is also some positive evidence in the memorabilia (mem.) the	0
5769	the imperius curse, moody said.  i was under my fathers control.  i was forced to wear an invisibility cloak day and night.  i was always with the house-elf.  she was my keeper and caretaker.  she pitied me.  she persuaded my father to give me occasional treats.  rewards for my good behavior.	1
21652	this entire allegory, i said, you may now append, dear glaucon, to the	0
13765	a great people'--resounds through the whole work. like socrates, cicero	0
17293	love is of the right sort?	0
14860	common mode of speaking. but to be perfectly accurate, since you are	0
12347	of mankind? can 'the spectator of all time and all existence' be quite	0
15804	honour justice; or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears justice	0
779	there you go, ron yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of gold coins into harry's hand, for the omnioculars!  now you've got to buy me a christmas present, ha!	1
12564	of animals aims chiefly at size or speed or strength; in a few cases at	0
17135	together; even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute?	0

4318	enter, said snape in his usual voice.	1
17882	they will pass their whole life in much greater terror of internal than	0
19086	then let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse; the	0
8385	three parts of the soul and one of the three classes in the state,	0

3498	when all the food had been consumed, dumbledore stood up and asked the students to do the same.  then, with a wave of his wand, all the tables zoomed back along the walls leaving the floor clear, and then he conjured a raised platform into existence along the right wall.  a set of drums, several guitars, a lute, a cello, and some bagpipes were set upon it.	1
25234	regarded seriously as attaining to the truth; and he who listens to her,	0
5212	you all right? said bill, grinning at harry and shaking his hand.  charlie wanted to come, but he couldn't get time off.  he said you were incredible against the horntail.	1
4196	he snatched up the stone, which krum had dropped, but the mermen now closed in around ron and the little girl, shaking their heads at him. harry pulled out his wand.	1
19068	which wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses. but never mind	0
7073	of justice; secondly, of the manner in which men view justice as a	0
2967	she bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say, how does it feel now, diggory?	1
23321	again, let us see how the democratical man grows out of the	0

5189	the window was open, said harry. i opened it to breathe.	1
15926	and they exchange with one another, and one gives, and another receives,	0
25365	the soul, i said, being, as is now proven, immortal, must be the fairest	0

20548	more skilful adversaries and have no piece to move, so they too find	0
13184	ideas recovered from a former state of existence affect his theory	0
23500	yes, he said, i know it too well.	0
16917	yes, i said; but there may be more than this in question: i really do	0
8143	mistress. 'well, and what answer do you give?' my answer is, that	0
23184	as fellow-soldiers or fellow-sailors; aye and they may observe the	0

25996	spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of	0
24922	and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped	0
4159	relashio!  harry shouted, except that no sound came out. ... a large bubble issued from his mouth, and his wand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for where it struck them, angry red patches appeared on their green skin.  harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam, as fast as he could, occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random; every now and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again, and he kicked out, hard; finally, he felt his foot connect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw the dazed grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, while its fellows shook their fists at harry and sank back into the weed.	1
1822	oh yes, said neville, i'm fine, thanks.  just reading this book professor moody lent me. . .	1
18796	you remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a kind	0
17348	my meaning may be learned from homer; he, you know, feeds his heroes at	0
18558	and so of the individual; we may assume that he has the same three	0

3542	people were starting to stare at them.	1
12752	the animals, to revert to a common or original stock. but we have a	0
4552	what yeh done ter your hands, hermione?  said hagrid, looking concerned.	1
10366	representative of timocracy; he walks at first in the ways of his	0
10933	has satisfied his desires just enough to prevent their perturbing his	0
6757	the attention is not distracted by any reference to the audience; nor	0
4198	only bubbles flew out of his mouth, but he had the distinct impression that the mermen had understood him, because they suddenly stopped laughing.  their yellowish eyes were fixed upon harry's wand, and they looked scared.  there might be a lot more of them than there were of him, but harry could tell, by the looks on their faces, that they knew no more magic than the giant squid did.	1
14748	he consented to begin. behold, he said, the wisdom of socrates; he	0
22528	authority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.	0
19154	innovation; how they will talk of women's attainments both in music	0
2255	no!  said ron loudly, but nobody heard him except harry; the uproar from the next table was too great.  every single hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet, screaming and stamping, as cedric made his way past them, grinning broadly, and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers' table.  indeed, the applause for cedric went on so long that it was some time before dumbledore could make himself heard again.	1
15300	'very good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'yes'	0
13781	of injustice as a principle of government, while the other, laelius,	0
1524	the tension that had filled the hall ever since moody's arrival suddenly broke.  nearly everyone laughed, and dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.	1
8869	all the world will take off his coat and rush upon you with sticks and	0
12541	should be poorly recompensed by improvements in the breed for the loss	0
16943	of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies.	0
15040	heaven forbid! i said; i would only ask you to be consistent; or, if you	0
19563	they will never know. the way will be this:--dating from the day of the	0

7924	unfrequently a tangled thread which in an age before logic the poet was	0
12498	easily change in the course of generations through the mode of life; and	0
9578	we are dissatisfied when we are told that the idea of good can only be	0
62	liar, breathed the second voice.  i am no stronger, and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health i have regained under your clumsy care.  silence!	1

22951	and so at last, instead of loving contention and glory, men become	0
1608	no, said hermione, with as much dignity as she could muster with her mouth bulging with sprouts.  i just want to get to the library.	1
7409	evil, and god the author, is a wicked, suicidal fiction which we will	0
8038	origin; the platonic republic may also have a tale of earthborn men. the	0
6927	that rulers are solely actuated by love of office. 'no doubt about it,'	0

8378	or every man doing another's business. i do not say that as yet we are	0

21056	many entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders, who rush	0
20570	i perceive, i said, that you are vastly amused at having plunged me into	0
3324	completely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly back up to gryffindor tower, cho's voice echoing in his ears with every step he took. cedric - cedric diggory.  he had been starting to quite like cedric - prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at quidditch, and was handsome, and popular, and nearly everyone's favorite champion.  now he suddenly realized that cedric was in fact a useless pretty boy who didn't have enough brains to fill an eggcup.	1
393	er - why are you calling that owl pig? harry asked ron.	1
2810	harry barely slept that night.  when he awoke on monday morning, he seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from hogwarts.  but as he looked around the great hall at breakfast time, and thought about what leaving the castle would mean, he knew he couldn't do it.  it was the only place he had ever been happy. . . well, he supposed he must have been happy with his parents too, but he couldn't remember that.	1
10864	given in the first part of the passage (greek...): (2) that the	0
14987	other much. observe also what happens when they take an office; there is	0
22257	assuredly not, he said; i have hardly ever known a mathematician who was	0
5613	she and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the golden web, while the death eaters flitted around the outside of it... and voldemort's dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers, whispered words of encouragement to harry, and hissed words harry couldn't hear to voldemort.	1
15971	and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is	0
25089	that we should take counsel about what has happened, and when the dice	0
7131	'when a lively-minded ingenuous youth hears all this, what will be his	0
1785	harry had been picturing his parents' deaths over and over again for three years now, ever since he'd found out they had been murdered, ever since he'd found out what had happened that night:  wormtail had betrayed his parents' whereabouts to voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage.  how voldemort had killed harry's father first.  how james potter had tried to hold him off, while he shouted at his wife to take harry and run. . . voldemort had advanced on lily potter, told her to move aside so that he could kill harry.. . how she had begged him to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son.. . and so voldemort had murdered her too, before turning his wand on harry.	1
19434	which lovers know, and which is far more convincing and constraining to	0
14285	celebrate the festival, which was a new thing. i was delighted with the	0
19943	hellenes; and, indeed, we have reason to fear that the offering of	0
7512	necessarily occur in the early stages of all religions. we know also	0
2206	yeah, said hagrid sadly. s' okay, though, i've got 'em in separate boxes now.  still got abou' twenty.	1
11783	the poets, as he says in the protagoras, were the sophists of their day;	0
11220	and unnecessary pleasure, which is repeated by aristotle, and he now	0

21777	unlike that of other states, in which men fight with one another about	0

17616	and in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?	0
4476	good idea, said ron. give pig something to do. you couldn't give us a bit of extra food, could you?  he said to the surrounding elves, and they bowed delightedly and hurried off to get some more.	1

2003	there was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day.  nobody was very attentive in lessons, being much more interested in the arrival that evening of the people from beauxbatons and durmstrang; even potions was more bearable than usual, as it was half an hour shorter.  when the bell rang early, harry, ron, and hermione hurried up to gryffindor tower, deposited their bags and books as they had been instructed, pulled on their cloaks, and rushed back downstairs into the entrance hall.	1

1555	harry, ron, and neville climbed up the last, spiral staircase until they reached their own dormitory, which was situated at the top of the tower.  five four-poster beds with deep crimson hangings stood against the walls, each with its owner's trunk at the foot.  dean and seamus were already getting into bed; seamus had pinned his ireland rosette to his headboard, and dean had tacked up a poster of viktor krum over his bedside table.  his old poster of the west ham football team was pinned right next to it.	1
443	mr. weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had their homemade strawberry ice cream, and by the time they had finished, moths were fluttering low over the table, and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle.  harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes, laughing madly and closely pursued by crookshanks.	1

772	angry yells were filling the stadium. the crowd didn't want the veela to go. harry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting bulgaria, and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest.  ron, meanwhile, was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat.  mr. weasley, smiling slightly, leaned over to ron and tugged the hat out of his hands.	1
15299	have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and i will answer	0
22887	further, when she sees her husband not very eager about money, and	0

381	just then a door on the second landing opened, and a face poked out wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression.	1
23697	verily, then, tragedy is a wise thing and euripides a great tragedian.	0
21701	knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the	0

4817	are you mad?  said ron.  tell percy?  he'd probably do a crouch and turn them in. he stared at the window through which fred and george's owl had departed, then said, come on, let's get some breakfast.	1

2845	on his desk stood what looked hike a large, cracked, glass spinning top; harry recognized it at once as a sneakoscope, because he owned one himself, though it was much smaller than moody's.  in the corner on a small table stood an object that looked something like an extra-squiggly, golden television aerial.  it was humming slightly.  what appeared to be a mirror hung opposite harry on the wall, but it was not reflecting the room.  shadowy figures were moving around inside it, none of them clearly in focus.	1
3225	harry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at hogwarts for christmas; he always did, of course, because the alternative was usually going back to privet drive, but he had always been very much in the minority before now.  this year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to harry to be obsessed with the coming ball - or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how many girls hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never quite noticed that before.  girls giggling and whispering in the corridors, girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to wear on christmas night... .	1

1379	the great hall looked its usual splendid self, decorated for the start-of-term feast. golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and hundreds of candles, floating over the tables in midair.  the four long house tables were packed with chattering students; at the top of the hall, the staff sat along one side of a fifth table, facing their pupils.  it was much warmer in here.  harry, ron, and hermione walked past the slytherins, the ravenclaws, and the hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the gryffindors at the far side of the hall, next to nearly headless nick, the gryffindor ghost.  pearly white and semitransparent, nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet, but with a particularly large ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking extra-festive, and insuring that his head didn't wobble too much on his partially severed neck.	1

881	the floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent and harry recognized one of them:  mr. roberts, the campsite manager.  the other three looked as though they might be his wife and children.  one of the marchers below flipped mrs. roberts upside down with his wand; her nightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee.	1

1382	the sorting of the new students into houses took place at the start of every school year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, harry hadn't been present at one since his own.  he was quite looking forward to it.  just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table.	1

15408	which could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any	0
5604	if ever harry might have released his wand from shock, it would have been then, but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of golden light remained unbroken, even though the thick gray ghost of cedric diggory (was it a ghost? it looked so	1
257	ten past five ... then a quarter past five ... harry was starting to feel anxious himself now.  at half past, he heard uncle vernon and aunt petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room.	1
10386	incur a loss which is to be repaid only by barren honour; in time of	0
20545	at the end of the discussion they are found to have sustained a mighty	0

11366	all the poets are only imitators, who do but imitate the appearances of	0
3846	harry moved forward, looking around, his footsteps echoing off the walls.  magnificent though the bathroom was - and quite keen though he was to try out a few of those taps - now he was here he couldn't quite suppress the feeling that cedric might have been having him on. how on earth was this supposed to help solve the mystery of the egg?  nevertheless, he put one of the huffy towels, the cloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the swimming-pool-sized bath, then knelt down and turned on a few of the taps.	1
339	harry didn't want to miss the fun, but uncle vernon's second ornament narrowly missed his left ear, and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to mr. weasley.  he stepped into the fire, looking over his shoulder as he said the burrow!  his last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of mr. weasley blasting a third ornament out of uncle vernon's hand with his wand, aunt petunia screaming and lying on top of dudley, and dudley's tongue lolling around like a great slimy python.  but next moment harry had begun to spin very fast, and the dursleys' living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald-green flames.	1

4937	harry sat down in a chair in front of dumbledore's desk.  for several minutes, he sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their frames, thinking about what he had just heard, and running his fingers over his scar.  it had stopped hurting now.	1
411	i don't know where we went wrong with them, said mrs. weasley, putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans.  it's been the same for years, one thing after another, and they won't listen to - oh not again!	1
17289	then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love?	0
19953	why, you see, there is a difference in the names 'discord' and 'war,'	0
4954	harry gazed, nonplussed, at dumbledore, then around at the silently watchful crowd, then back at dumbledore.  and then it dawned on him. . . .	1

3071	harry noticed her eyes travel over dean (who had a nasty cut across one cheek). lavender (whose robes were badly singed), seamus (who was nursing several burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where most of the class stood, their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear.	1
12533	both of bodily and mental qualities might be possible. the analogy of	0
2063	i don't believe it! ron said, in a stunned voice, as the hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind the party from durmstrang. krum, harry!  viktor krum!	1
4228	the judges went into a huddle.  madam pomfrey had gone to rescue ron from percy's clutches; she led him over to harry and the others, gave him a blanket and some pepperup potion, then went to fetch fleur and her sister.  fleur had many cuts on her face and arms and her robes were torn, but she didn't seem to care, nor would she allow madam pomfrey to clean them.	1

5361	he was lifted into the air in its front legs; struggling madly, he tried to kick it; his leg connected with the pincers and next moment he was in excruciating pain. he could hear cedric yelling stupefy! too, but his spell had no more effect than harry's - harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted expelliarmus!	1

1651	arnold weasley, who was charged with possession of a flying car two years ago, was yesterday involved in a tussle with several muggle law-keepers (policemen) over a number of highly aggressive dustbins. mr. weasley appears to have rushed to the aid of mad-eye moody, the aged ex-auror who retired from the ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted murder. unsurprisingly, mr. weasley found, upon arrival at mr. moody's heavily guarded house, that mr. moody had once again raised a false alarm. mr. weasley was forced to modify several memories before he could escape from the policemen, but refused to answer daily prophet questions about why he had involved the ministry in such an undignified and potentially embarrassing scene.	1

157	but aunt petunia didn't know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs.  she had no idea that harry was not following the diet at all.  the moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks, harry had sent hedwig to his friends with pleas for help, and they had risen to the occasion magnificently.  hedwig had returned from hermione's house with a large box stuffed full of sugar-free snacks.  (hermione's parents were dentists.)  hagrid, the hogwarts gamekeeper, had obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes.  (harry hadn't touched these; he had had too much experience of hagrid's cooking.)  mrs. weasley, however, had sent the family owl, errol, with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies.  poor errol, who was elderly and feeble, had needed a full five days to recover from the journey.  and then on harry's birthday (which the dursleys had completely ignored) he had received four superb birthday cakes, one each from ron, hermione, hagrid, and sirius.  harry still had two of them left, and so, looking forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs, he ate his grapefruit without complaint.	1

2165	harry watched, fascinated, as fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket bearing the words fred weasley - hogwarts.  fred walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there, rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fifty-foot drop. then, with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him, he took a great breath and stepped over the line.	1

2166	for a split second harry thought it had worked - george certainly thought so, for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after fred - but next moment, there was a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shot-putter.  they landed painfully, ten feet away on the cold stone floor, and to add insult to injury, there was a loud popping noise, and both of them sprouted identical long white beards.	1

3096	she seized harry's arm and started to try to drag him back along the corridor.	1
11909	reason distinguishes man from the animals; and to banish art would be	0

13916	which reason, he tells us, the citizens of utopia were the more willing	0

2251	oh look, they're all disappointed, hermione said over the noise, nodding toward the remainder of the beauxbatons party.  disappointed was a bit of an understatement, harry thought.  two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.	1

2681	the back of hagrid's enormous shaggy head - he had mercifully abandoned his bunches - emerged over the crowd.  harry wondered why he hadn't spotted him at once, as hagrid was so large, but standing up carefully, he saw that hagrid had been leaning low, talking to professor moody.  hagrid had his usual enormous tankard in front of him, but moody was drinking from his hip flask.  madam rosmerta, the pretty landlady, didn't seem to think much of this; she was looking askance at moody as she collected glasses from tables around them. perhaps she thought it was an insult to her mulled mead, but harry knew better.  moody had told them all during their last defense against the dark arts lesson that he preferred to prepare his own food and drink at all times, as it was so easy for dark wizards to poison an unattended cup.	1

940	harry snorted with laughter. he recognized the pimply wizard:  his name was stan shunpike, and he was in fact a conductor on the triple-decker knight bus.  he turned to tell ron this, but ron's face had gone oddly slack, and next second ron was yelling,  did i tell you i've invented a broomstick that'll reach jupiter?	1

6162	tell me about it, said george.  'course, we found out what was going on in the end. lee jordan's dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off bagman as well.  turns out he's in big trouble with the goblins.  borrowed loads of gold off them.  a gang of them cornered him in the woods after the world cup and took all the gold he had, and it still wasn't enough to cover all his debts.  they followed him all the way to hogwarts to keep an eye on him.  he's lost everything gambling.  hasn't got two galleons to rub together.  and you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back?	1

14579	well, there is another question: by friends and enemies do we mean those	0

3285	a pair of... what, excuse me?	1
2151	without another word, professor karkaroff swept his students away with him.  moody watched him until he was out of sight, his magical eye fixed upon his back, a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face.	1
15027	do not keep your knowledge to yourself; we are a large party; and any	0

390	yeah, yeah, all right, said ron, and he started off upstairs again.  percy slammed his bedroom door shut.  as harry, hermione, and ginny followed ron up three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them.  it sounded as though mr. weasley had told mrs. weasley about the toffees.	1
2207	well, that's lucky, said ron. hagrid missed the sarcasm.	1
19256	to maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same	0
24136	coming on the stage, and i must judge them in the order in which they	0
11927	concerned with the inferior part of the soul'; that the readers of them	0
3325	fairy lights, he said dully to the fat lady - the password had been changed the previous day.	1
238	she nipped his finger affectionately, then, with a soft swooshing noise, spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open window.	1
7308	acting upon them from without, but, if at all, by education fashioning	0

18180	really statesmen, and these are not much to be admired.	0
9189	path. i hesitated to make the assertion which i now hazard,--that our	0
5733	dumbledore bent down over moody's limp form and put a hand inside his robes.  he pulled out moody's hip flask and a set of keys on a ring.  then he turned to professors mcgonagall and snape.	1
1265	oh go on, then, said mr. diggory.	1
18060	what may that be? he asked.	0
552	aye, i would, said mr. roberts. and who're you?	1
8198	be needed for the lesser matters of life--rules of deportment or	0
19185	say: 'socrates and glaucon, no adversary need convict you, for you	0

15262	that, i suppose, can hardly be denied.	0

17138	the shepherds may have a pipe in the country.	0
15673	i was going to say something in answer to glaucon, when adeimantus, his	0
25462	old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen; they are	0
14513	and what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of	0
2766	okay, said harry slowly.  but. . . are you saying karkaroff put my name in the goblet?  because if he did, he's a really good actor.  he seemed furious about it.  he wanted to stop me from competing.	1
10517	squeezed when the drones have need of their possessions; there is	0
4494	other people manage to do their own housework, you know, winky, hermione said severely.	1
14262	greater and better than themselves, and which in endless forms, whether	0
14431	well said, cephalus, i replied; but as concerning justice, what is	0

13415	the everlasting question and answer--the ceaseless interrogative of	0
15193	that you will call injustice honourable and strong, and to the unjust	0
5037	mother! screamed the boy below, and the wispy little witch beside crouch began to sob, rocking backward and forward.  mother, stop him.  mother, i didn't do it, it wasn't me!	1
2652	what about ron, though?  he said.  don't you want to go with him?	1
14453	his meaning, though probably clear to you, is the reverse of clear to	0
6295	influence. the republic of plato is also the first treatise upon	0
10430	such is democracy;--a pleasing, lawless, various sort of government,	0
13687	passages in the laws, such as the honour due to the soul, the evils	0
5980	the great black dog looked up at dumbledore, then, in an instant, turned back into a man.	1
13953	divinity (perhaps 'a late famous vicar of croydon in surrey,' as the	0
3795	you don't want to go upsetting rita skeeter, said ron nervously. i'm serious, hermione, she'll dig up something on you -	1
18022	either there are many smaller divisions, and you would be altogether	0
751	how do you do, how do you do?  said fudge, smiling and bowing to mrs. malfoy. and allow me to introduce you to mr. oblansk - obalonsk - mr. - well, he's the bulgarian minister of magic, and he can't understand a word i'm saying anyway, so never mind.  and let's see who else - you know arthur weasley, i daresay?	1

10904	the first seven digits multiplied by one another. the contrast of the	0
25755	charge for the ebooks, unless you receive specific permission.  if you	0
21760	observe, glaucon, that there will be no injustice in compelling our	0
19936	gear behind him,--is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at his	0
15562	of this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust power to do	0
4489	winky swayed some more, staring blurrily at harry.	1
6080	we will see each uzzer again, i 'ope, said fleur as she reached him, holding out her hand.  i am 'oping to get a job 'ere, to improve my eenglish.	1
3383	ooooh - who?  she said keenly.	1
10205	like the youth in the philebus, they are ready to discourse to any one	0

8898	if he has knowledge we rejoice to hear it, but knowledge must be of	0
2598	harry got to his feet and walked past krum to mr. ollivander.  he handed over his wand.	1
21205	and pleasures which we mentioned before, but there is another kind of	0
5109	you know - you know the trial you found me in?  the one with crouch's son?  well....were they talking about neville's parents?	1
25898	hart, the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark.  contact the	0
684	mr. crouch raised his eyebrows at bagman.	1
25846	work or any other work associated with project gutenberg-tm.	0
7686	first. as we banished strains of lamentation, so we may now banish the	0
19121	whether the result accords with our design.	0
24893	i say, that he would not have had many followers, and been honoured and	0
9252	their corresponding worlds--one of the visible, the other of the	0
21968	finger, there would be nothing to attract towards being; but when there	0
3527	yes, he did, said hermione, the pink patches on her cheeks glowing more brightly. so what?	1
7728	life and experience. there is a music of the soul which answers to the	0
10633	aristotle's mode of using words, would have been called a timocracy;	0
9392	and interests. the 'monster' corporation to which they belong judges	0
7727	essential forms of the virtues, and then trace their combinations in	0
6058	he paused, and his eyes fell upon the hufflepuff table.  theirs had been the most subdued table before he had gotten to his feet, and theirs were still the saddest and palest faces in the hall.	1
1569	yeah. . . and you were hungry, said ron, grinning.	1
726	freedom is going to dobby's head, sir,  said winky sadly.  ideas above his station, sir.  can't get another position, sir.	1
18291	and in what part that quality resides which gives the name of courageous	0
14380	are impatient of old age, the same reply may be made; for to the good	0
13070	have a conception of the varieties of human character, and to be raised	0
2973	caught on, have you?  said harry coldly.  took you long enough.	1
12520	the sexes supposed by him are the reverse of licentious: he seems rather	0
23436	and the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things	0
11801	to him all particulars appear to be floating about in a world of sense;	0
25677	of being rough and underground, would be smooth and heavenly. most	0
21257	which, any other knowledge or possession of any kind will profit us	0
7284	do his duty first, without asking whether he will be happy or not, and	0
11367	things. for as a painter by a knowledge of figure and colour can paint a	0
24848	of himself works many and fair; and, instead of being the author of	0
12949	other abstract ideas, exercised over the mind of plato. to us the state	0
5815	harry got up and swayed again; the pain in his leg, which he had not noticed all the time he had been listening to crouch, now returned in full measure.  he also realized that he was shaking.  dumbledore gripped his arm and helped him out into the dark corridor.	1
4206	and then he felt his head break the surface of the lake; wonderful, cold, clear air was making his wet face sting; he gulped it down, feeling as though he had never breathed properly before, and, panting, pulled ron and the little girl up with him.  all around him, wild, green-haired heads were emerging out of the water with him, but they were smiling at him.	1
19916	in what respect do you mean?	0
8219	nostrums, and fancying that they can cut off at a blow the hydra-like	0
3595	'ow dare you! shrieked madame maxime.  her voice exploded through the peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him.  harry heard fleur and roger fall out of their rosebush.  i 'ave nevair been more insulted in my life!  'alf-giant?  moi?  i 'ave - i 'ave big bones!	1
10676	in his utter helplessness and suspiciousness is leading an almost	0
3917	filch's footsteps halted; there was a clink of metal on metal and the wailing stopped - filch had picked up the egg and closed it.  harry stood very still, one leg still jammed tightly in the magical step, listening.  any moment now, filch was going to pull aside the tapestry, expecting to see peeves . . . and there would be no peeves ... but if he came up the stairs, he would spot the marauder's map . . . and invisibility cloak or not, the map would show  harry potter standing exactly where he was.	1
12418	at which we may arrive in two or three generations is beyond the power	0
23659	speak their minds to him and to one another, and the more courageous of	0
577	i thought mr. bagman was head of magical games and sports, said ginny, looking surprised.  he should know better than to talk about bludgers near muggles, shouldn't he?	1
3817	not all of 'em, said hagrid hoarsely. not all of 'em wan me ter stay.	1
11600	speaking thus, he cast the lots among them and each one took up the	0
15291	never seen before, thrasymachus blushing. as we were now agreed that	0
21299	and if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our state will be	0
7231	happiness of the unjust, to which the misery of the tyrant in book ix is	0
1664	there was a terrified silence in the entrance hall.  nobody but moody was moving a muscle.  moody turned to look at harry -- at least, his normal eye was looking at harry; the other one was pointing into the back of his head.	1
25783	entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.e.8.	0
20036	true, he replied; but what of that?	0
11106	or that of knowledge? consider the matter thus: the satisfaction of	0
20011	that the plan which you propose, if only feasible, would do all sorts of	0
3435	he threw dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped, and the hand-knitted sweater mrs. weasley had sent, dobby looked quite overwhelmed.	1
23331	and as in the city like was helping like, and the change was effected by	0
3836	tha's my boy. . . you show 'em, harry, you show 'em.  beat 'em all.	1
6686	hardly have failed to touch on the nature of family relations, for	0
19653	certainly he would not; for every one whom they meet will be regarded	0
10188	criticise customary beliefs, or to analyse the constitution of human	0
1872	and how do we do all this? harry asked.	1
22532	right, and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their fathers.	0
9958	time required for the gymnastics of the body; six, or perhaps five	0
23337	and if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within	0
14896	his skill and of his authority over the sailors.	0
10621	in which the timocratic state springs out of the ideal, and the mere	0
8889	you would acknowledge the existence of abstract ideas, such as justice,	0
24152	principles, the division may, i think, furnish a new demonstration.	0
20171	the dionysiac festivals as if they had let out their ears to hear every	0
7266	indirect. he does not say that happiness consists in the contemplation	0
3793	she'll be after you next, hermione, said ron in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the street.	1
20956	objections, which certainly showed that the discussion would be long and	0
5069	but why. bertha, said dumbledore sadly, looking up at the now silently revolving girl, why did you have to follow him in the first place?	1

25716	scorching heat to the plain of forgetfulness, which was a barren waste	0
3124	yes, sir, yes!  said dobby, and he seized harry's hand and pulled him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there.  each of these tables, harry noticed as he passed them, was positioned exactly beneath the four house tables above, in the great hall. at the moment, they were clear of food, dinner having finished, but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above.	1

2199	as they neared hagrid's cabin on the edge of the forbidden forest, the mystery of the beauxbatons' sleeping quarters was solved.  the gigantic powder-blue carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from hagrid's front door, and the students were climbing back inside it.  the elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it.	1
3114	i'm not asking you to!  hermione said impatiently.  i came down here just now, to talk to them all, and i found - oh come on, harry, i want to show you!	1

694	a sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the afternoon wore on.  by dusk, the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with anticipation, and as darkness spread like a curtain over the thousands of waiting wizards, the last vestiges of pretence disappeared:  the ministry seemed to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now breaking out everywhere.	1
22188	and to one another, and any other things that are material and visible	0
19988	then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?	0

2617	i know better than anyone that you can look after yourself and while you're around dumbledore and moody i don't think anyone will be able to hurt you.  however, someone seems to be having a good try. entering you in that tournament would have been very risky, especially right under dumbkdore's nose.	1
5064	a connection i could have made without assistance, dumbledore sighed, but never mind.  he peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles at harry, who was gaping at snape's face, which was continuing to swirl around the bowl.  i was using the pensieve when mr. fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather hastily.  undoubtedly i did not fasten the cabinet door properly.  naturally, it would have attracted your attention.	1
20008	this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the	0
22847	for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and	0

14197	such ideals cannot be recalled, though the recollection of them may	0
5329	okay, he said. can i hear the riddle?	1
18124	it would seem, adeimantus, that the direction in which education starts	0
5967	there is work to be done, he said.  molly... am i right in thinking that i can count on you and arthur?	1
6872	of praise from socrates, he is induced to open the game. 'listen,' he	0
4365	sirius paced all around the cave in silence.  then he said, harry, did you check your pockets for your wand after you'd left the top box?	1
20416	and how can we rightly answer that question?	0

3841	on thursday night, harry sneaked up to bed, put on the cloak, crept back downstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when hagrid had shown him the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open.  this time it was ron who waited outside to give the fat lady the password (banana fritters), good luck, ron muttered, climbing into the room as harry crept out past him.	1
11847	reason, to inspire even for a moment courage or resignation; perhaps to	0
11855	necessarily partakes of the nature of a compromise. something of ideal	0

11823	greece and rome. for no government of men depends solely upon force;	0

11805	bed, etc.; nor is the truth which is displayed in individual instances	0
3720	yeah, but there's still the giant squid, said ron.  he didn't sound anxious - if anything, he sounded hopeful.  hermione noticed his tone of voice and frowned.	1

4821	when the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corridors toward the dark arts classroom and found professor moody leaving it.  he looked as tired as they felt.  the eyelid of his normal eye was drooping, giving his face an even more lopsided appearance than usual.	1

2896	she was leading him toward the place where the dragons were, around the edge of the forest, but when they approached the clump of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible, harry saw that a tent had been erected, its entrance facing them, screening the dragons from view.	1
25655	and let not the last despair.' and when he had spoken, he who had the	0
14474	simonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to have spoken	0
21849	to that good which you are now seeking.	0
15154	if, i said, he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all the	0
18693	and does not the same principle hold in the sciences? the object of	0
5484	no one spoke.  no one moved except wormtail, who was upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding arm.	1
5195	yes, said hermione breathlessly.  she ran her fingers through her hair again, and then held her hand up to her mouth, as though speaking into an invisible walkie-talkie.  harry and ron stared at each other.	1
3188	you know what?  said ron, once he, hermione, and harry had left the kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again.  all these years i've been really impressed with fred and george, nicking food from the kitchens - well, it's not exactly difficult, is it?  they can't wait to give it away!	1

8791	has a happiness beyond that of any cobbler. at the same time, if any	0

869	they were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their campsites. raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the lantern-lit path, and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads, cackling and waving their lanterns.  when they finally reached the tents, nobody felt like sleeping at all, and given the level of noise around them, mr. weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in.  they were soon arguing enjoyably about the match; mr. weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with charlie, and it was only when ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that mr. weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed.  hermione and ginny went into the next tent, and harry and the rest of the weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks.  from the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang.	1
25536	the upper world, but the mouth, instead of admitting them, gave a roar,	0
3020	he's supposed to work out the clue on his own, hermione said swiftly.  it's in the tournament rules. . . .	1
23752	liberty, getting out of all order and reason, passes into the harshest	0
10505	passes into the excess of slavery, and the greater the freedom the	0
2260	parchment.  he held it out and stared at the name written upon it.  there was a long pause, during which dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared at dumbledore.  and then dumbledore cleared his throat and read out - harry potter.	1
569	it's like some sort of... i dunno ... like some sort of rally, said mr. roberts.  they all seem to know each other.  like a big party.	1
18874	and would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements	0
2641	but harry couldn't ignore it.  ron hadn't spoken to him at all since he had told him about snape's detentions.  harry had half hoped they would make things up during the two hours they were forced to pickle rats' brains in snape's dungeon, but that had been the day rita's article had appeared, which seemed to have confirmed ron's belief that harry was really enjoying all the attention.	1

23767	of the appetites, and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always	0

12161	to the spartan type the ideal state reverts in the first decline; and	0
510	now we just need the portkey, said mr. weasley, replacing his glasses and squinting around at the ground.  it won't be big.... come on...	1
19777	he will cease to be a guardian, and is not content with this safe and	0
5974	minerva, said dumbledore, turning to professor mcgonagall, i want to see hagrid in my office as soon as possible.  also - if she will consent to come - madame maxime.	1
1189	don't you dare blame your father for what that wretched skeeter woman wrote!  said mrs. weasley, flaring up at once.	1

11710	the decline and decay both in literature and in politics which marked	0
11762	the peacefulness of nature. plato has himself admitted, in the earlier	0
25587	there is another band, three in number, each sitting upon her throne:	0
24518	what shall we say to him?	0
25054	and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten	0
7553	plato as a lie of this hateful sort. the greatest unconsciousness of the	0
23003	the evil is certainly not prevented there; for oligarchies have both the	0
25296	things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through	0
800	fingers in your ears! bellowed mr. weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration. harry screwed up his eyes too; he wanted to keep his mind on the game. after a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the field.  the veela had stopped dancing, and bulgaria was again in possession of the quaffle.	1

2439	he paused at this point, thinking. he had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night, but he couldn't think how to translate this into words, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote,	1

5863	sirius's grip on harry's shoulder was now so tight it was painful.	1
20247	then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter	0

5833	the phoenix let out one soft, quavering note.  it shivered in the air, and harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach, warming him, and strengthening him.	1
417	they had only gone a few paces when hermione's bandy-legged ginger cat, crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottle-brush tail held high in the air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs.  harry recognized it instantly as a gnome.  barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the wellington boots that lay scattered around the door.  harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to reach it. meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house.  the source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden, and saw that bill and charlie both had their wands out, and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each other, each attempting to knock the other's out of the air.  fred and george were cheering, ginny was laughing, and hermione was hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiety.	1
7832	rule the younger; and the best of the elders will be the best guardians.	0
12076	and act accordingly. all men cannot have the first choice in everything.	0
13135	perform acts more than human. plato does not appear to have analysed	0
22081	departments of knowledge, as experience proves, any one who has studied	0
1010	come off it, amos, said mr. weasley quietly, you don't seriously think it was the elf?  the dark mark's a wizard's sign.  it requires a wand.	1

2130	dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it, where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the hall.	1

23808	discountenanced the unnecessary, which aim only at amusement and	0
1813	but ron fell suddenly silent at the look on harry's face and didn't speak again until they reached the great hall, when he said he supposed they had better make a start on professor trelawney's predictions tonight, since they would take hours.	1
7818	the passionate disposition when it has too much gymnastic is hardened	0
6284	politics has been little recognised, and the recognition is the	0
16511	speaking--because we do not know the truth about ancient times, we make	0
12097	there still remain to be considered some points which have been	0
8659	to share in the employments of men. and here we may be charged with	0
8433	'the shorter will satisfy me.' well then, you would admit that the	0
12749	but scarcely less often the differences which distinguish children both	0
5486	and then i ask myself, but how could they have believed i would not rise again?  they, who knew the steps i took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death?  they, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when i was mightier than any wizard living?	1
22839	undoubtedly, he said, the form of government which you describe is a	0
17570	the other; for vice cannot know virtue too, but a virtuous nature,	0
9528	so far as the thought contained in it admits of being translated	0
404	i think they've stopped arguing, said hermione, to cover the awkward moment, because ginny was looking curiously from ron to harry.  shall we go down and help your mum with dinner?	1
12671	which seems to be natural is inconsistent with the primitive theory of	0
2210	go on, hagrid! harry, ron, and hermione urged him, but he just shook his head, grinning.	1
22626	these they will train in their own habits and laws, i mean in the laws	0
12516	is a wonderful thing, that one of the wisest and best of men should have	0
8809	cowards and deserters shall be degraded to the class of husbandmen;	0
24127	supremely miserable, and that he makes everybody else as miserable as	0
25249	three score years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison	0
487	what? said george, in an innocent tone that deceived nobody.	1
15716	supply. such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the	0
2676	hermione lapsed into thoughtful silence, while harry drank his butterbeer, watching the people in the pub.  all of them looked cheerful and relaxed.  ernie macmillan and hannah abbot were swapping chocolate frog cards at a nearby table; both of them sporting support cedric diggory! badges on their cloaks.  right over by the door he saw cho and a large group of her ravenclaw friends.  she wasn't wearing a cedric badge though. . . . this cheered up harry very slightly.	1
23214	in the first place, are they not free; and is not the city full of	0
4371	the malfoys!  said ron suddenly, so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave, and buckbeak tossed his head nervously.  i bet it was lucius malfoy!	1

18306	i should like to hear what you are saying once more, for i do not think	0
24807	yes, he said, the difference is only apparent.	0
2556	well. . . they say it's going to be a lot safer this year, said harry.	1
7054	the dialectical process, here as always, is to enlarge our conception of	0
14823	wisest of men, is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker	0
26024	concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared	0
22941	a fortune the less they think of virtue; for when riches and virtue are	0
6134	thought we'd see what those three were up to, said fred matter-of-factly, stepping onto goyle and into the compartment.  he had his wand out, and so did george, who was careful to tread on malfoy as he followed fred inside.	1
9009	if they are good. what do you say?' i should say that he is quite right.	0
16660	of having any shame or self-control, he will be always whining and	0
10906	corrections of the cycle, which were made first by meton and secondly	0
24840	the question, he said, should by all means be considered.	0
19433	yes, he said;--necessity, not geometrical, but another sort of necessity	0

7169	interest of the stronger, but right is the necessity of the weaker.	0

8781	no younger man will strike an elder; reverence will prevent him from	0
10398	into a family of children, and is reduced into a state of dronage by	0
15756	likely to be affected, my dear socrates,--those of them, i mean, who are	0

2694	at half past eleven that evening, harry, who had pretended to go up to bed early, pulled the invisibility cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs through the common room. quite a few people were still in there.  the creevey brothers had managed to get hold of a stack of support cedric diggory!  badges and were trying to bewitch them to make them say support harry potter! instead.  so far, however, all they had managed to do was get the badges stuck on potter stinks.  harry crept past them to the portrait hole and waited for a minute or so, keeping an eye on his watch.  then hermione opened the fat lady for him from outside as they had planned.  he slipped past her with a whispered thanks!  and set off through the castle.	1
22116	why, yes, i said, and for two reasons:--in the first place, no	0
2094	i'll take your word for it, said ron, helping himself to black pudding.	1
15422	proper excellence and have a defect instead?	0
17765	and, speaking generally, i agree with you, he said.	0
18532	the state, there will be no longer any room for doubt; if it be not	0
12788	which is really terrible to us. for what we have received from our	0
1505	it is also my painful duty to inform you that the inter-house quidditch cup will not take place this year.	1
23919	whom evil communications have brought in from without, or those whom	0
22448	to the mind in childhood; not, however, under any notion of forcing our	0
19740	i hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they will	0
5720	you're mad, harry said - he couldn't stop himself- you're mad!	1
13939	clement and peter giles, citizen of antwerp, with whom he disputes	0
14669	or some other rich and mighty man, who had a great opinion of his own	0
21572	and if they were able to converse with one another, would they not	0
5797	my master sent me word of my father's escape.  he told me to stop him at all costs. so i waited and watched.  i used the map i had taken from harry potter.  the map that had almost ruined everything.	1
3207	the yule ball is of course a chance for us all to - er - let our hair down, she said, in a disapproving voice.	1
6464	of the lord,' or the suffering servant or people of god, or the 'sun of	0
4720	lie still for a moment, dumbledore said.	1
5790	he asked me whether i was ready to risk everything for him.  i was ready.  it was my dream, my greatest ambition, to serve him, to prove myself to him.  he told me he needed to place a faithful servant at hogwarts.  a servant who would guide harry potter through the triwizard tournament without appearing to do so.  a servant who would watch over harry potter.  ensure he reached the triwizard cup.  turn the cup into a portkey, which would take the first person to touch it to my master.  but first -	1
13474	the minds of all. he has no sufficient idea of the effect of literature	0
10221	he expresses for distinctions of words, the danger of involuntary	0
24588	and luxury and softness are blamed, because they relax and weaken this	0
9557	sign, of socrates, which here, as always in plato, is only prohibitory;	0
8213	he who indulges them and fawns upon them, is their leader and saviour.	0
6091	have you got a new headmaster yet?  said harry	1
1150	he bustled out of the kitchen.  mrs. weasley looked most upset. arthur, you're supposed to be on holiday! this hasn't got anything to do with your office; surely they can handle this without you?	1
10428	education,--how little she cares for the training of her statesmen! the	0
12450	female animals have the same pursuits--why not also the two sexes of	0
22653	true, i said; and now that this division of our task is concluded, let	0
10760	every right-angled triangle, the squares of the two lesser sides equal	0
22055	then if geometry compels us to view being, it concerns us; if becoming	0
204	how many times do i have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof?  he hissed, his face now a rich plum color.  you stand there, in the clothes petunia and i have put on your ungrateful back -	1
19413	to enquire how the rulers will carry out these arrangements, and i shall	0
21790	yes, my friend, i said; and there lies the point. you must contrive for	0

13059	be resting on a creation of his own mind only. but if we may be allowed	0
25344	and well awake too; so far removed is her dwelling-place from being a	0
15111	three modes of payment, money, or honour, or a penalty for refusing.	0
24487	then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number	0
5662	what happened. harry?  the man asked at last as he lifted harry up the stone steps. clunk.  clunk.  clunk.  it was mad-eye moody.	1

2383	i'm tired! he bellowed finally, after nearly half an hour.  no, seriously, george - i'm going to bed -	1
4932	i wanted to talk to you. professor, harry said quickly, looking at dumbledore, who gave him a swift, searching look.	1
7885	instead of helpers, and the hour of ruin, both to themselves and the	0
7115	some go further, and speak of a fair posterity in the third and fourth	0
1604	well, that won't matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something, will it? said ron, grinning slyly at her.	1
570	at that moment, a wizard in plus-fours appeared out of thin air next to mr. roberts's front door.	1

4254	what were you going to do, snore at them?  said hermione waspishly.  people had been teasing her so much about being the thing that viktor krum would most miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood.	1
8962	as of metaphysical philosophy; and the love of universal knowledge is	0
6077	harry's trunk was packed; hedwig was back in her cage on top of it.  he, ron, and hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the fourth years for the carriages that would take them back to hogsmeade station.  it was another beautiful summer's day.  he supposed that privet drive would be hot and leafy, its flower beds a riot of color, when he arrived there that evening.  the thought gave him no pleasure at all.	1
23993	tyranny is the wretchedest form of government, and the rule of a king	0
14328	me eagerly, and then he said:--	0
9208	without which though a man gain the world he has no profit of it! some	0
10154	institution may have darkened their vision. the church of the future,	0
19780	head shall seek to appropriate the whole state to himself, then he will	0

11187	more and more wicked? or what shall he profit by escaping discovery, if	0
5072	the silvery light from the pensieve illuminated dumbledore's face, and it struck harry suddenly how very old he was looking.  he knew, of course, that dumbledore was getting on in years, but somehow he never really thought of dumbledore as an old man.	1
3082	i would think, she said, in a mystical whisper that did not conceal her obvious annoyance, that some of us - she stared very meaningfully at harry- might be a little less  frivolous had they seen what i have seen during my crystal gazing last night.  as i sat here, absorbed in my needlework, the urge to consult the orb overpowered me.  i arose, i settled myself before it, and i gazed into its crystalline depths . . . and what do you think i saw gazing back at me?	1
300	mr. weasley was looking around.  he loved everything to do with muggles.  harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder.	1
17926	features their due proportion, we make the whole beautiful. and so i say	0

3184	as they prepared to take their leave, many of the surrounding elves pressed in upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs.  hermione refused, with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying, but harry and ron loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies.	1

5370	that's not how it's supposed to work, harry said.  he felt angry; his leg was very painful, he was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider, and after all his efforts, cedric had beaten him to it, just as he'd beaten harry to ask cho to the ball.  the one who reaches the cup first gets the points.  that's you. i'm telling you, i'm not going to win any races on this leg.	1

12281	paradoxes of plato are at least as paradoxical to us as they were to his	0
520	long walk, arthur?  cedric's father asked.  not too bad, said mr. weasley.  we live just on the other side of the village there. you?	1

419	will you keep it down?! he bellowed.	1

4625	no, it's okay, mr. bagman, said harry, suppressing a smile, i think i can find the castle on my own, thanks.	1

5167	breakfast was a very noisy affair at the gryffindor table on the morning of the third task. the post owls appeared, bringing harry a good-luck card from sirius.  it was only a piece of parchment, folded over and bearing a muddy paw print on its front, but harry appreciated it all the same.  a screech owl arrived for hermione, carrying her morning copy of the daily prophet as usual.  she unfolded the paper, glanced at the front page, and spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over it.	1
23054	and the son has seen and known all this--he is a ruined man, and his	0
3733	bagman led harry along the bar to the end furthest from madam rosmerta.	1

1905	the owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold and drafty, because none of the windows had glass in them.  the floor was entirely covered in straw, owl droppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles.  hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right up to the top of the tower, nearly all of them asleep, though here and there a round amber eye glared at harry.  he spotted hedwig nestled between a barn owl and a tawny, and hurried over to her, sliding a little on the dropping-strewn floor.	1
24041	and must not such a state and such a man be always full of fear?	0
20737	when is this accomplished? he said.	0

2258	the fire in the goblet had just turned red again. sparks were flying out of it. a long flame shot suddenly into the air, and borne upon it was another piece of parchment.	1
4533	ow!  said hermione, tears starting in her eyes as she tried to rub the pus off her hands with a napkin, but her fingers were now so thickly covered in painful sores that it looked as though she were wearing a pair of thick, knobbly gloves.	1
18278	will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a	0
1536	they can't do that!  said george weasley, who had not joined the crowd moving toward the door, but was standing up and glaring at dumbledore.  we're seventeen in april, why can't we have a shot?	1
24501	what a wonderful calculation! and how enormous is the distance which	0
5669	made a potion . . . got his body back. . . .	1

2350	but madame maxime had already put her arm around fleur's shoulders and was leading her swiftly out of the room.  harry could hear them both talking very fast in french as they went off into the great hall.  karkaroff beckoned to krum, and they, too, exited, though in silence.	1

7112	poets add a similar picture of another. the heroes of musaeus and	0

22619	justice as the greatest and most necessary of all things, whose	0
756	mr. malfoy's eyes had returned to hermione, who went slightly pink, but stared determinedly back at him.  harry knew exactly what was making mr. malfoy's lip curl like that. the malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods; in other words, they considered anyone of muggle descent, like hermione, second-class.  however, under the gaze of the minister of magic, mr. malfoy didn't dare say anything.  he nodded sneeringly to mr. weasley and continued down the line to his seats.  draco shot harry, ron, and hermione one contemptuous look, then settled himself between his mother and father.	1

584	all of them stood back to admire their handiwork.  nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards, harry thought, but the trouble was that once bill, charlie, and percy arrived, they would be a party of ten. hermione seemed to have spotted this problem too; she gave harry a quizzical look as mr. weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent.	1
5943	i see no evidence to the contrary!  shouted fudge, now matching her anger, his face purpling.  it seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years!	1

3563	percy didn't look happy about this at all, and harry was prepared to bet he would be rushing to tell mrs. weasley about this the moment he got home. apparently fred and george's plans had grown even more ambitious lately, if they were hoping to sell to the public.  bagman opened his mouth to ask harry something, but percy diverted him.	1

5441	harry realized what wormtail was about to do a second before it happened - he closed his eyes as tightly as he could, but he could not block the scream that pierced the night, that went through harry as though he had been stabbed with the dagger too.  he heard something fall to the ground, heard wormtail's anguished panting, then a sickening splash, as something was dropped into the cauldron.  harry couldn't stand to look . . . but the potion had turned a burning red; the light of it shone through harry's closed eyelids. . . .	1

2407	harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room. the moment he appeared, the people who had already finished breakfast broke into applause again.  the prospect of going down into the great hall and facing the rest of the gryffindors, all treating him like some sort of hero, was not inviting; it was that, however, or stay here and allow himself to be cornered by the creevey brothers, who were both beckoning frantically to him to join them. he walked resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open, climbed out of it, and found himself face-to-face with hermione.	1
1032	everyone in the clearing looked at him.	1
4993	harry could tell that, this time, karkaroff had struck gold. the watching crowd was all murmuring together.	1

5426	the liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast.  the surface began not only to bubble, but to send out fiery sparks, as though it were on fire.  steam was thickening, blurring the outline of wormtail tending the fire.  the movements beneath the robes became more agitated.  and harry heard the high, cold voice again.	1

2699	there was an air of enormous excitement about hagrid.  he was wearing a flower that resembled an oversized artichoke in his buttonhole.  it looked as though he had abandoned the use of axle grease, but he had certainly attempted to comb his hair - harry could see the comb's broken teeth tangled in it.	1
24564	come, now, and let us gently reason with the unjust, who is not	0
19606	or that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the	0
5298	the skrewt was inches from him when it froze - he had managed to hit it on its fleshy, shell-less underside.  panting, harry pushed himself away from it and ran, hard, in the opposite direction - the impediment curse was not permanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.	1
587	well, it's not for long, said mr. weasley, mopping his bald patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom.  i borrowed this from perkins at the office.  doesn't camp much anymore, poor fellow, he's got lumbago.	1

597	she had trodden on the giant slug, which burst.  her scolding carried after them on the still air, mingling with the little boy's yells - you bust slug!  you bust slug!	1
4335	they went into gladrags wizardwear to buy a present for dobby, where they had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find, including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars, and another that screamed loudly when they became too smelly. then, at half past one, they made their way up the high street, past dervish and banges, and out toward the edge of the village.	1

1999	why d'you have to keep changing owls?  ron asked in a low voice.	1
5777	but winky didn't know that i was growing stronger.  i was starting to fight my father's imperius curse.  there were times when i was almost myself again.  there were brief periods when i seemed outside his control.  it happened, there, in the top box.  it was like waking from a deep sleep.  i found myself out in public, in the middle of the match, and i saw, in front of me, a wand sticking out of a boys pocket.  i had not been allowed a wand since before azkaban.  i stole it.  winky didn't know.  winky is frightened of heights.  she had her face hidden.	1

20771	what are you going to say?	0
5322	harry moved on, continuing to use the four-point spell, making sure he was moving in the right direction.  it was between him and cedric now.  his desire to reach the cup first was now burning stronger than ever, but he could hardly believe what he'd just seen krum do.  the use of an unforgivable curse on a fellow human being meant a life term in azkaban, that was what moody had told them. krum surely couldn't have wanted the triwizard cup that badly....harry sped up.	1
14475	darkly of the nature of justice; for he really meant to say that justice	0

5812	severus - dumbledore turned to snape - please tell madam pomfrey to come down here; we need to get alastor moody into the hospital wing.  then go down into the grounds, find cornelius fudge, and bring him up to this office.  he will undoubtedly want to question crouch himself.  tell him i will be in the hospital wing in half an hour's time if he needs me.	1
2728	what breeds you got here, charlie?  said hagrid, gazing at the closest dragon, the black one, with something chose to reverence.  its eyes were still just open.  harry could see a strip of gleaming yellow beneath its wrinkled black eyelid.	1
3874	too late, it's gone, it wont come back	1
16045	probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another. i cannot	0

11915	he who thinks must feel before he can execute. and the highest thoughts,	0
1460	harry looked away, staring very hard at the sorting hat, now sorting emma dobbs.	1
2342	mr. crouch turned to look at dumbledore.	1
4317	there was a knock on the dungeon door.	1
9902	the process of selection may be carried a step further:--as before, they	0
25212	shall i propose, then, that she be allowed to return from exile, but	0
19020	such is the good and true city or state, and the good and true man is	0
3790	sit down, you silly little girl, and don't talk about things you don't understand, said rita skeeter coldly, her eyes hardening as they fell on hermione.  i know things about ludo bagman that would make your hair curl... not that it needs it - she added, eyeing hermione's bushy hair.	1
249	he hadn't thought of that. how were the weasleys going to pick him up?  they didn't have a car anymore; the old ford anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the forbidden forest at hogwarts.  but mr. weasley had borrowed a ministry of magic car last year; possibly he would do the same today?	1
6887	ruler thinks to be his interest will always remain what he thinks to be	0
23381	waste magnificence, and impudence courage. and so the young man	0

9233	senses, requiring not only objects of sense, but also a medium, which is	0
16803	to be spoken of, let us see whether any have been omitted by us. the	0
2377	you'll be able to pay back diggory for that last quidditch match, harry!  shrieked katie bell, another of the gryffindor chasers.	1
4390	of course, sirius muttered, pacing up and down, of course, he'd want to pin it on anyone but his own elf... and then he sacked her?	1
16810	but we are not in a condition to answer this question at present, my	0
8184	one with himself, and then the whole city would be united. but all these	0
12760	and so ridiculous is the fancy which has been entertained by some that	0
2113	she was pointing up at the staff table. the two remaining empty seats had just been filled. ludo bagman was now sitting on professor karkaroff's other side, while mr. crouch, percy's boss, was next to madame maxime.	1

22362	in all that i should most certainly agree with you.	0
20447	let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort	0
25297	their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so	0
10564	their honour will fail and become 'too asthmatic to mount.' to return to	0

4676	i'll get dumbledore if you let me go, mr. crouch! said harry. he looked furiously around at krum. help me, will you?	1

19760	yes, he said, and glorious rewards they are.	0
2271	harry got to his feet, trod on the hem of his robes, and stumbled slightly.  he set off up the gap between the gryffindor and hufflepuff tables.  it felt like an immensely long walk; the top table didn't seem to be getting any nearer at all, and he could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon him, as though each were a searchlight.  the buzzing grew louder and louder.  after what seemed like an hour, he was right in front of dumbledore, feeling the stares of all the teachers upon him.	1

1366	through the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what was fast becoming a gale. leaning against the window, harry could see hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain. lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps. people who had occupied the carriages in front were already hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. harry, ron, hermione, and neville jumped down from their carriage and dashed up the steps too, looking up only when they were safely inside the cavernous, torch-lit entrance hall, with its magnificent marble staircase.	1
6052	when he, ron, and hermione entered the hall, they saw at once that the usual decorations were missing.  the great hall was normally decorated with the winning house's colors for the leaving feast.  tonight, however, there were black drapes on the wall behind the teachers' table.  harry knew instantly that they were there as a mark of respect to cedric.	1

18067	that will be the best way of settling them.	0
5805	there was complete silence now, except for winky's continued sobs.  then dumbledore said, and tonight. . .	1

25322	either, then, let us refute this conclusion, or, while it remains	0

4046	ron quite liked the idea of using the summoning charm again - harry had explained about aqua-lungs, and ron couldn't see why harry shouldn't summon one from the nearest muggle town.  hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that, in the unlikely event that harry managed to learn how to operate an aqua-lung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the international code of wizarding secrecy - it was too much to hope that no muggles would spot an aqua-lung zooming across the countryside to hogwarts.	1
2375	 i didn't, harry said.  i don't know how -	1

5944	harry couldn't believe what he was hearing.  he had always thought of fudge as a kindly figure, a little blustering, a little pompous, but essentially good-natured.  but now a short, angry wizard stood before him, refusing, point-blank, to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world - to believe that voldemort could have risen.	1
12644	elements enter into this 'mystery' than are dreamed of by plato and some	0

2213	a light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was very cozy sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window, watching hagrid darning his socks and arguing with hermione about house-elves - for he flatly refused to join s.p.e.w. when she showed him her badges.	1
9119	and now the question recurs and has not grown easier:--how may	0
25634	and what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth,	0
4467	poor old snuffles, said ron, breathing deeply.  he must really like you.  harry. . . . imagine having to live off rats.	1

3617	out in the entrance hall, harry and ron saw hermione saying good night to krum before he went back to the durmstrang ship.  she gave ron a very cold look and swept past him up the marble staircase without speaking.  harry and ron followed her, but halfway up the staircase harry heard someone calling him.	1

8180	it must be neither too large nor too small to be one. this is a matter	0
4230	yeah, said harry, who was now heartily wishing he'd left all three girls tied to the statue.	1
20782	all this, he calls his knowledge wisdom, and makes of it a system or	0
16820	but if you admit that i am right in this, then i shall maintain that you	0

11426	off his guard because the sorrow is another's; and he thinks that he	0

2727	all right, hagrid?  he panted, coming over to talk.  they should be okay now - we put them out with a sleeping draft on the way here, thought it might be better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet - but, like you saw, they weren't happy, not happy at all -	1

8280	to depend upon them. in the most commercial and utilitarian states	0
173	we have never been introduced, but i am sure you have heard a great deal from harry about my son ron.	1
4793	he was holding a sealed envelope in his hands.  harry glanced at it, but fred, whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted his hand so that the name on it was covered.	1
23503	glorious indeed, he said. but what is the next step?	0
4125	- 'the prospect's black,' harry recited, staring, horror-struck, at the elf.  'too late, it's gone, it won't come back.'  dobby - what've i got to do?	1
5918	when harry touched the triwizard cup tonight, he was transported straight to voldemort, said dumbledore steadily.  he witnessed lord voldemort's rebirth.  i will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office.	1

2391	well. . . no one else got across the age line, said ron.  not even fred and george. what did you use - the invisibility cloak?	1
603	it was seamus finnigan, their fellow gryffindor fourth year.  he was sitting in front of his own shamrock-covered tent, with a sandy-haired woman who had to be his mother, and his best friend, dean thomas, also of gryffindor.	1

6074	every guest in this hall, said dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the durmstrang students, will be welcomed back here at any time, should they wish to come.  i say to you all, once again - in the light of lord voldemort's return, we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.  lord voldemorts gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. we can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust.  differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.	1

705	their money bags considerably lighter, they went back to the tents.  bill, charlie, and ginny were all sporting green rosettes too, and mr. weasley was carrying an irish flag.  fred and george had no souvenirs as they had given bagman all their gold.	1
8216	people tell them.' and when all the world is telling a man that he is	0
24359	which is like contrasting black with grey instead of white--can you	0
14972	and that they are not studying their own advantage day and night. oh,	0
10389	next comes democracy and the democratic man, out of oligarchy and	0
4314	no, said harry, with complete honesty this time.	1
8148	having painted the eye, which is the noblest feature of the face, not	0
11380	faith--neither science nor true opinion can be ascribed to him.	0
3843	the door creaked open. harry slipped inside, bolted the door behind him, and pulled off the invisibility cloak, looking around.	1
20846	reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and taken	0
22273	then this is the progress which you call dialectic?	0
9592	over the minds of men. the meagreness or negativeness of their content	0

5995	yeah, said harry.  yeah . . . of course i do.	1
22397	certainly, he said; he must have natural gifts.	0
2400	i didn't put my name in that goblet! said harry, starting to feel angry.	1

17956	i think that you are quite right.	0

16870	or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then	0

18620	themselves; we should rather say that they have both an axis and a	0

19401	well, i said, i submit to my fate. yet grant me a little favour: let	0
9802	now, will you appeal to mankind in general or to the philosopher? or	0
1789	now, if there's no countercurse, why am i showing you?  because you've got to know.  you've got to appreciate what the worst is.  you don't want to find yourself in a situation where you're facing it.  constant vigilance!  he roared, and the whole class jumped again.	1

10542	in the early days of his tyranny he smiles and beams upon everybody; he	0
4550	well, let's check how yeh've done! said hagrid.  count yer coins!  an' there's no point tryin' ter steal any, goyle, he added, his beetle-black eyes narrowed.  it's leprechaun gold.  vanishes after a few hours.	1

2464	the next few days were some of harry's worst at hogwarts.  the closest he had ever come to feeling like this had been during those months, in his second year, when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow students.  but ron had been on his side then.  he thought he could have coped with the rest of the school's behavior if he could just have had ron back as a friend, but he wasn't going to try and persuade ron to talk to him if ron didn't want to.  nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all sides.	1

'course, i can' remember her too well. . . she left, see.  when i was abou' three.  she wasn' really the maternal sort.  well. . . it's not in their natures, is it?  dunno what happened to her . . . might be dead fer all i know. ...	1

4267	there they are, there they are!  she giggled, and the knot of slytherins broke apart. harry saw that pansy had a magazine in her hands - witch weekly.  the moving picture on the front showed a curly-haired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand.	1
1898	he heard ron come up into the dormitory a short while later, but did not speak to him. for a long time, harry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his bed.  the dormitory was completely silent, and, had he been less preoccupied, harry would have realized that the absence of neville's usual snores meant that he was not the only one lying awake.	1

1398	 the words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the great hall opened and silence fell.  professor mcgonagall was leading a long line of first years up to the top of the hall.  if harry, ron, and hermione were wet, it was nothing to how these first years looked. they appeared to have swum across the lake rather than sailed.  all of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school - all of them except the smallest of the lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was wrapped in what harry recognized as hagrid's moleskin overcoat.  the coat was so big for him that it hooked as though he were draped in a furry black circus tent.  his small face protruded from over the collar, looking almost painfully excited.  when he had lined up with his terrified-looking peers, he caught colin creevey's eye, gave a double thumbs-up, and mouthed, i fell in the lake!  he looked positively delighted about it.	1

9857	these things are only the prelude, and you surely do not suppose that a	0
1611	when the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons, harry and ron set off for north tower where, at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase, a silver stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling, and the room where professor trelawney lived.	1
880	more wizards were joining the marching group, laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies.  tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled.  once or twice harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with his wand.  several caught fire.  the screaming grew louder.	1

20316	then i suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge,	0
1933	yeah, i know, said ron, who was skipping on every alternate step.  he had had much more difficulty with the curse than harry, though moody assured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime.  talk about paranoid. . . ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that moody was definitely out of earshot and went on.  no wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the ministry.  did you hear him telling seamus what he did to that witch who shouted 'boo' behind him on april fools' day?  and when are we supposed to read up on resisting the imperius curse with everything else we've got to do?	1
4091	we'll meet you back in the common room, hermione told harry as she got up to go with ron - both of them looked very anxious.  bring as many of these books as you can, okay?	1
22183	and will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at	0
8215	cleverness? 'nay, some of them are stupid enough to believe what the	0

13515	neither have they teachers or advisers with whom they can take counsel	0
22407	of learning or listening or enquiring. or the occupation to which he	0
9693	a clever rogue peers out of his eyes, and the more clearly he sees, the	0
21727	released from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction,	0
22025	yes; that is a marked characteristic of it.	0
4953	but dumbledore didn't move or speak.  he ignored harry completely.  like every other wizard on the benches, he was staring into the far corner of the room, where there was a door.	1
13032	intimate that the state of knowledge which then existed was not such as	0

5800	for a week i waited for my father to arrive at hogwarts.  at last, one evening, the map showed my father entering the grounds.  i pulled on my invisibility cloak and went down to meet him.  he was walking around the edge of the forest.  then potter came, and krum.  i waited.  i could not hurt potter; my master needed him.   potter ran to get dumbledore.  i stunned krum.  i killed my father.	1
5039	in unison, the witches and wizards along the right-hand side of the dungeon raised their hands.  the crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for bagman, their faces full of savage triumph.  the boy began to scream.	1
3471	once everyone else was settled in the hall, professor mcgonagall told the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow her.  they did so, and everyone in the great hall applauded as they entered and started walking up toward a large round table at the top of the hall, where the judges were sitting.	1
1229	you've got to be kidding, said ron in disbelief.  i'm not wearing that, no way.	1
4941	the surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl very fast.	1
14947	and the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, is a ruler of	0
11132	spurious ones: the tyrant goes beyond even the latter; he has run away	0

1384	it was colin creevey, a third year to whom harry was something of a hero.	1
19706	dear to them, and therefore they all tend towards a common end.	0
3482	it now occurred to harry that he had never actually heard krum speak before, but he was certainly talking now, and very enthusiastically at that.	1
21190	and all solid principle goes out of them.	0
1553	balderdash, said george, a prefect downstairs told me.	1
25096	yes, i said; and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion	0

13582	to have had a great share in political events. the wiser of them like	0
22791	why, yes, i said, of course they answer truly; how can the muses speak	0
4168	and to recover what we took...	1
25815	the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united	0
392	shut up, pig, said ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room.  fred and george are in here with us, because bill and charlie are in their room, he told harry.  percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he's got to work.	1
14653	then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man,	0
8483	and brutes; and homer affords a proof of the distinction between them	0
1965	ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like lockhart!	1

21192	on the other hand, those steadfast natures which can better be depended	0
655	mr. weasley looked on helplessly as ludo bagman whipped out a notebook and quill and began jotting down the twins' names.	1

7603	truth should have a high place among the virtues, for falsehood, as	0
4233	fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him. hermione looked simply furious, but just then, ludo bagman's magically magnified voice boomed out beside them, making them all jump, and causing the crowd in the stands to go very quiet.	1
18910	at the beginning of our work of construction, that some divine power	0
14843	statement. tell me, thrasymachus, i said, did you mean by justice what	0
10097	indistinguishable from the simple sensation, which is the medium of	0

7949	preceded them. the thought of our own times has not out-stripped	0
10751	parallel passage in the ninth book. another help is the allusion in	0
19334	the very great benefit has next to be established?	0
849	what did he catch the snitch for?  ron bellowed, even as he jumped up and down, applauding with his hands over his head. he ended it when ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot!	1
14050	princes; on the state of the world and of knowledge. the hero of his	0

22664	seen all the individuals, and finally agreed as to who was the best and	0
12408	mass of mankind having power, and becoming enlightened about the higher	0
22687	forms of government. but these are nondescripts and may be found equally	0
5251	harry got up.  the gryffindors all along the table were applauding him; the weasleys and hermione all wished him good luck, and he headed off out of the great hall with cedric, fleur, and viktor.	1
21885	which leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly	0
25580	the other, and of these the swiftest is the eighth; next in swiftness	0
9303	of the many. he is aware of the importance of 'classifying according to	0

16034	on the level of companionship; still they have plenty of bodily strength	0
25294	of the soul. take the analogy of the body: the evil of the body is a	0

6565	that the virtues follow the analogy of the arts. from his brother lysias	0
885	bill, charlie, and percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming marchers; mr. weasley tore after them. ministry wizards were dashing from every direction toward the source of the trouble.  the crowd beneath the roberts family was coming ever closer.	1
10042	recognize the grasp of plato's mind in his ability to conceive of	0
13513	would be disappointing. the destination of most men is what plato would	0
1632	seamus and dean, who were working nearby, sniggered loudly, though not loudly enough to mask the excited squeals from lavender brown - oh professor, look! i think i've got an unaspected planet! oooh, which one's that, professor?	1
9027	and to explain to them that not he, but those who will not use him, are	0
6053	the real mad-eye moody was at the staff table now, his wooden leg and his magical eye back in place.  he was extremely twitchy, jumping every time someone spoke to him.  harry couldn't blame him; moodys fear of attack was bound to have been increased by his ten-month imprisonment in his own trunk.  professor karkaroff s chair was empty.  harry wondered, as he sat down with the other gryffindors, where karkaroff was now, and whether voldemort had caught up with him.	1
25751	set forth in the general terms of use part of this license, apply to	0
25444	and what do they receive of men? look at things as they really are, and	0
5877	harry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to dumbledore for asking the others not to question him.  it wasn't as though he didn't want them there; but the thought of explaining it all over again, the idea of reliving it one more time, was more than he could stand.	1
14039	some reasonable cause, all that gorgeousness of apparel seemed shameful	0
9061	education save him from being carried away by the torrent? nor is this	0

14232	world as in another. neither is it inconceivable that some rare nature	0
4501	winky's eyelids drooped and suddenly, without warning, she slid off her stool into the hearth, snoring loudly.  the empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away across the stone-flagged floor.  half a dozen house-elves came hurrying forward, looking disgusted.  one of them picked up the bottle; the others covered winky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly, hiding her from view.	1
4112	he looked down at his watch.  dobby was right.  it was twenty past nine.  a large, dead weight seemed to fall through harry's chest into his stomach.	1
20654	but will go on--the keen edge will not be blunted, nor the force of his	0
4063	you okay. harry?  hagrid muttered, moving aside slightly, while most of the others swarmed around the baby unicorns.	1
5119	as to that, i have no idea.	1
21157	more remains to be discussed;--how and by what studies and pursuits will	0
11251	times we sometimes use metaphorically what plato employed as a	0
21860	a something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common,	0
13908	was beginning to be heard. to minds like more's, greek literature was	0
20210	beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which	0
16933	and comedy--did you not just now call them imitations?	0
11569	and in four days came to a spot whence they looked down upon a line of	0
17468	a further question, whether this dieting of disorders, which is an	0
3247	no one, yet, said harry, feeling himself going red again.  hagrid didn't pursue the subject.	1
21362	then reflect; has the ear or voice need of any third or additional	0
8005	also very different from anything which existed at all in his age of	0

5724	moody was thrown backward onto the office floor.  harry, still staring at the place where moody's face had been, saw albus dumbledore, professor snape, and professor mcgonagall looking back at him out of the foe-glass.  he looked around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway, dumbledore in front, his wand outstretched.	1

5573	voldemort raised his wand, and before harry could do anything to defend himself, before he could even move, he had been hit again by the cruciatus curse.  the pain was so intense, so all-consuming, that he no longer knew where he was. . . . white-hot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely going to burst with pain, he was screaming more loudly than he'd ever screamed in his life -	1
15284	and each of them is such as his like is?	0
3746	listen, harry, he said (still in a very low voice), i feel very bad about all this . . . you were thrown into this tournament, you didn't volunteer for it... and if. . . (his voice was so quiet now, harry had to lean closer to listen) if i can help at all... a prod in the right direction . . . i've taken a liking to you . . . the way you got past that dragon! . . . well, just say the word.	1
2060	karkaroff beckoned forward one of his students.  as the boy passed, harry caught a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows.  he didn't need the punch on the arm ron gave him, or the hiss in his ear, to recognize that profile.	1

2834	cedric was still hooking at him in a slightly suspicious way when harry heard a familiar clunking noise behind him.  he turned around and saw mad-eye moody emerging from a nearby classroom.	1
20203	and he who, having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute	0
17476	a house, an army, or an office of state; and, what is most important	0

2529	maybe not that small, ludo, said rita skeeter, her eyes on harry.	1
1545	people have died, though!  said hermione in a worried voice as they walked through a door concealed behind a tapestry and started up another, narrower staircase.	1
4218	she's fine! harry tried to tell her, but he was so exhausted he could hardly talk, let alone shout.	1

1080	come on, you three, mr. weasley said quietly.  but hermione didn't seem to want to move; her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf.  hermione! mr. weasley said, more urgently. she turned and followed harry and ron out of the clearing and off through the trees.	1
5678	voldemort's back, harry?  you're sure he's back?  how did he do it?	1
11060	the ambitious man will despise knowledge which brings no honour; whereas	0

14524	then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than	0
525	harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him, used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it always made him feel uncomfortable.	1

17464	nay, he said, i think that he had better begin somewhat sooner.	0

2257	but dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking, and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted him.	1
1808	moody's blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed harry.  then he said, you've got to know.  it seems harsh, maybe, but you've got to know.  no point pretending. . . well.. . come on, longbottom, i've got some books that might interest you.	1

1826	harry and ron took their copies of unfogging the future back down to the common room, found a table, and set to work on their predictions for the coming month.  an hour later, they had made very little progress, though their table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols, and harry's brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from professor trelawney's fire.	1
24535	that, he said, is an easier task; and i have made them as you say.	0
22384	having noble and generous tempers, they should also have the natural	0
13511	one gives himself. men and women cannot be brought together in schools	0
2685	moody limped around the table and bent down; harry thought he was reading the s.p.e.w. notebook, until he muttered, nice cloak, potter.	1
3526	ron chose to ignore this. i s'pose he asked you to come with him while you were both in the library?	1

10382	he will soon prove that he is not without the will, and that his	0
13350	abstractions and trying to get rid of the illusions of sense, nearly	0
4615	there will be obstacles, said bagman happily, bouncing on the balls of his feet. hagrid is providing a number of creatures . . . then there will be spells that must be broken ... all that sort of thing, you know.  now, the champions who are leading on points will get a head start into the maze. bagman grinned at harry and cedric. then mr. krum will enter . . . then miss delacour.  but you'll all be in with a fighting chance, depending how well you get past the obstacles.  should be fun, eh?	1
23547	then there is another class which is always being severed from the mass.	0
7230	glaucon has been drawing a picture of the misery of the just and the	0
18720	thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little, nor of good nor bad,	0
12666	to which the human race may sink through war, disease, or isolation.	0
14655	i think that what you say is quite true, socrates.	0
7377	but what shall their education be? is any better than the old-fashioned	0

22500	do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in	0

198	harry felt a second stab of annoyance.	1
11013	his mind is full of confusion; he is the very reverse of a freeman. the	0
11176	flattery and meanness again arise when the spirited element is subjected	0
4408	crouch's son was caught?  gasped hermione.	1
21480	thus:--there are two subdivisions, in the lower of which the soul uses	0
2250	it's her, ron!  harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up between the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables.	1
8476	following case:--when a man suffers justly, if he be of a generous	0
25222	certainly, he said, we shall be the gainers.	0
1851	oh am i?  said ron, peering down at his predictions.  i'd better change one of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff.	1
6064	cedric diggory was murdered by lord voldemort.	1
21820	which is little better than night to the true day of being, that is, the	0
5692	karkaroff's gone?  he ran away?  but then - he didn't put my name in the goblet?	1
124	asleep was the way harry liked the dursleys best; it wasn't as though they were ever any help to him awake.  uncle vernon, aunt petunia, and dudley were harry's only living relatives.  they were muggles who hated and despised magic in any form, which meant that harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot.  they had explained away harry's long absences at hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to st. brutus's secure center for incurably criminal boys.  they knew perfectly well that, as an underage wizard, harry wasn't allowed to use magic outside hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house.  harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world.  the very idea of going to them when they awoke, and telling them about his scar hurting him, and about his worries about voldemort, was laughable.	1

4333	karkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon.  he looked both worried and angry.  not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry snape, harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell ron and hermione what he had just witnessed.	1
14029	because they were originally of the same race with them. he is	0
16494	or uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of	0
13941	(imaginary) portuguese traveller, raphael hythloday. 'i have the more	0

22933	the accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is the	0
15104	not to the good of the superior. and this is the reason, my dear	0
385	what are you working on? said harry.	1
6938	the satire on existing governments is heightened by the simple and	0
18697	knowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is	0
14186	they require to be viewed at a certain distance, and are apt to fade	0

767	 but a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and harry's question was answered for him.  veela were women. . . the most beautiful women harry had ever seen. . . except that they weren't - they couldn't be - human.  this puzzled harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could make their skin shine moon-bright like that, or their white-gold hair fan out behind them without wind.. . but then the music started, and harry stopped worrying about them not being human - in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all.	1
9791	the real object of the study. it should elevate the soul, and create	0
25418	shown to confer reality, and not to deceive those who truly possess her,	0
18786	because he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more	0

9479	universal and particular. but the age of philosophy in which he lived	0
79	out in the corridor, frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat.  the man with the cold voice had killed a woman.  he was talking about it without any kind of remorse -- with amusement.  he was dangerous -- a madman.  and he was planning more murders -- this boy, harry potter, whoever he was -- was in danger --	1

16015	clearly they will buy and sell.	0
2305	she shot a very angry look at professor snape.	1
5209	utterly perplexed.  harry got up.  the dursleys couldn't possibly be here, could they? he walked across the hall and opened the door into the chamber.	1
8011	were raised by their great actions above the ordinary level of humanity;	0
2252	when fleur delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it.  the hogwarts champion next...	1
25372	then her beauty will be revealed, and justice and injustice and all the	0
733	house-elves is not supposed to have fun, harry potter, said winky firmly, from behind her hands.  house-elves does what they is told.  i is not liking heights at all, harry potter - she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped - but my master sends me to the top box and i comes, sir.	1
11414	secondly, he is concerned with an inferior part of the soul. he indulges	0
16243	then we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found them,	0
16831	i do not understand what you mean, said adeimantus.	0
8630	'do you think that we have come hither to dig for gold, or to hear you	0
3431	it was a lie; he hadn't bought anything for dobby at all, but he quickly opened his trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly rolled-up pair of socks.  they were his oldest and foulest, mustard yellow, and had once belonged to uncle vernon.  the reason they were extra-knobbly was that harry had been using them to cushion his sneakoscope for over a year now. he pulled out the sneako-scope and handed the socks to dobby, saying, sorry, i forgot to wrap them...	1
23195	and, as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without	0
1778	moody raised his wand, and harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding.	1
15729	extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the	0
9005	just as an unskilful player at draughts is reduced to his last move by	0
4101	the mermaid in the painting in the prefects' bathroom was laughing.  harry was bobbing like a cork in bubbly water next to her rock, while she held his firebolt over his head.	1
3637	harry didn't say anything.  he liked being back on speaking terms with ron too much to speak his mind right now - but he somehow thought that hermione had gotten the point much better than ron had.	1
5007	and then, the dungeon returned.  harry was sitting in a different seat, still on the highest bench, but now to the left side of mr. crouch.  the atmosphere seemed quite different: relaxed, even cheerful.  the witches and wizards all around the walls were talking to one another, almost as though they were at some sort of sporting event.  harry noticed a witch halfway up the rows of benches opposite.  she had short blonde hair, was wearing magenta robes, and was sucking the end of an acid-green quill.  it was, unmistakably, a younger rita skeeter.  harry looked around; dumbledore was sitting beside him again, wearing different robes.  mr. crouch looked more tired and somehow fiercer, gaunter. . . . harry understood. it was a different memory, a different day ... a different trial.	1
18034	and what, i said, will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when they	0
9060	a young man's heart leap amid these discordant sounds? and will any	0
100	i don't know what you mean by wizard, said frank, his voice growing steadier.  all i know is i've heard enough to interest the police tonight, i have.  you've done murder and you're planning more!  and i'll tell youthis too, he added, on a sudden inspiration, my wife knows i'm up here, and if i don't come back --	1
14061	all could ever see man himself in common, as they call him, though he be	0
22857	other respects in which he is very different.	0
17125	melodies, we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic	0
7333	again imports will be required, and imports necessitate exports,	0
8520	and the infinite forms of vice, among which are four special ones,	0
12881	natural impulses of affection: he died unmarried in a lunatic asylum.	0
10049	relation to one another, and to the idea of good, or common principle	0
2432	whose owl am i going to use? harry said as they climbed the stairs. he told me not to use hedwig again.	1
5302	and then harry heard krum's voice.	1
23895	to his very existence, and would place her under the authority of the	0
22069	that the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal,	0
8916	riddle--'a man and not a man shot and did not shoot a bird and not a	0
20628	who are called by them good-for-nothings and star-gazers.	0
25469	these, then, are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed	0
9246	surely mean pleasure,' he said. peace, i replied.) and this idea of	0
2453	hagrid's real intention, however, was totalk to harry away from the rest of the class. he waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then turned to harry and said, very seriously, so - yer competin', harry.  in the tournament.  school champion.	1
17311	in confirmation of my own, but my own belief is,--not that the good body	0
10367	father, who may have been a statesman, or general, perhaps; and	0
5636	then a pair of hands seized him roughly and turned him over.	1
900	never mind, ron, said hermione quickly, seizing ron's arm to restrain him as he took a step toward malfoy.	1
9801	which is better than the bodily eye, for by this alone is truth seen.	0
7121	prose:--virtue, as hesiod says, is honourable but difficult, vice is	0
18988	very essence of the vital principle is undermined and corrupted, life	0
15740	dwelling-place is near. but before virtue the gods have set toil,'	0
19570	be called their brothers and sisters, and these, as i was saying, will	0
23856	such is the man and such is his origin. and next, how does he live?	0
21961	impressions, invite thought; those which are not simultaneous do not.	0
21636	yes, he said, i think that he would rather suffer anything than	0
16290	children the authorised ones only. let them fashion the mind with such	0
19279	man gifted by nature from the one who is ungifted?	0
21628	on those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark	0
14017	opinion which places happiness in virtuous pleasures, but herein, as he	0
3584	i - i don't know what you mean, 'agrid. ...	1
11873	a substitute for the old poets. among ourselves the creative power seems	0
23737	of slaves and companions; but that his son should protect him, and that	0
18772	like the struggle of factions in a state, his spirit is on the side of	0
19062	a hornet's nest of words you are stirring. now i foresaw this gathering	0
8153	that they may work a little when they please; and cobblers and all the	0
8804	risk is worth incurring when the benefit is great. the young creatures	0

2283	but evidently zair 'as been a mistake, she said contemptuously to bagman.  e cannot compete. 'e is too young.	1
9905	that is to say, they must be quick at learning, capable of mental toil,	0
933	it's people like you, ron, hermione began hotly, who prop up rotten and unjust systems, just because they're too lazy to -	1

599	here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast.  some, with furtive looks around them, conjured fires with their wands; others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces, as though sure this couldn't work. three african wizards sat in serious conversation, all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a bright purple fire, while a group of middle-aged american witches sat gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between their tents that read:  the salem witches' institute.  harry caught snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed, and though he couldn't understand a word, the tone of every single voice was excited.	1

3290	er - yeah, that sounds about right, said ron.	1
2205	oh no, really?  said hermione, shooting a repressive look at ron, who, staring at hagrid's odd hairstyle, had just opened his mouth to say something about it.	1
3567	let's go for a walk, ron muttered to harry, get away from percy. ...	1
14609	and how is the error to be corrected?	0
234	he unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript.	1
3740	why are they looking for him here? said harry.  he's at the ministry in london, isn't he?	1
7486	from the intention, and that we must not be 'falsely true,' i.e. speak	0
25221	in poetry as well as a delight?	0

3270	well, you'd better hurry up, mate, or all the good ones will be gone, said fred.	1
3736	absolute nightmare, said bagman to harry in an undertone, noticing harry watching the goblins too.  their english isn't too good . . . it's like being back with all the bulgarians at the quidditch world cup . . . but at least they used sign language another human could recognize.  this lot keep gabbling in gobblede-gook . . . and i only know one word of gobbledegook.  bladvak.  it means 'pickax.'  i don't like to use it in case they think i'm threatening them.	1
20343	just is one, or that anything is one--to him i would appeal, saying,	0
6344	justice, and concluding, like some of the earlier dialogues, without	0
13367	this self-proving unity or idea of good is a mere vision of which no	0
11325	other imitator, is thrice removed from the king and from the truth.	0
430	ron rolled his eyes and muttered to harry and hermione, he's been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work.  probably an exhibition of thick-bottomed cauldrons.	1
17802	in the composition of these he has mingled gold, wherefore also	0

4899	harry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to dumbledores office without noticing.  he blinked, looked around, realized what he had done, and retraced his steps, stopping in front of it.  then he remembered that he didn't know the password.	1
14032	private, and is somewhat impatient of the importunity of relations. his	0

20494	or can such an one account death fearful?	0

4513	pigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the mountain by himself, so harry enlisted the help of two school screech owls as well.  when they had set off into the dusk, looking extremely odd carrying the large package between them.  harry leaned on the windowsill, looking out at the grounds, at the dark, rustling treetops of the forbidden forest, and the rippling sails of the durmstrang ship.  an eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from hagrids chimney; it soared toward the castle, around the owlery, and out of sight. looking down, harry saw hagrid digging energetically in front of his cabin.  harry wondered what he was doing; it looked as though he were making a new vegetable patch.  as he watched, madame maxime emerged from the beauxbatons carriage and walked over to hagrid.  she appeared to be trying to engage him in conversation.  hagrid leaned upon his spade, but did not seem keen to prolong their talk, because madame maxime returned to the carriage shortly afterward.	1
8580	we may observe how nearly plato approaches aristotle's famous thesis,	0
8026	caste, which existed in a great part of the ancient, and is by no means	0
22425	if only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education and	0
1810	what was that about?  said ron, watching neville and moody turn the corner.	1
2630	since when have you been one of the top students in the school, potter?  or is this a school you and longbottom have set up together?	1
8743	twenty years for a woman--from twenty to forty. any one above or below	0
17845	and therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries, being	0
12682	such speculations are apt to be unsettling, because they seem to show	0
23175	of luxury and idleness both of body and mind; they do nothing, and are	0
6385	attempts to determine the chronological order of the platonic writings	0
9387	plato would have us consider how easily the best natures are overpowered	0

263	what happened? said harry.  what's the matter?	1
1068	mr. diggory looked as though he didn't think much of this suggestion at all, but it was clear to harry that mr. crouch was such an important member of the ministry that he did not dare refuse him.	1

2016	and then dumbledore called out from the back row where he stood with the other teachers - aha!  unless i am very much mistaken, the delegation from beauxbatons approaches!	1
10374	immersed in calculation, the other absorbed in the admiration of	0
5036	you are further accused, bellowed mr. crouch, of using the cruciatus curse on frank longbottom's wife, when he would not give you information.  you planned to restore he-who-must-not-be-named to power, and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong. i now ask the jury -	1
8935	and greatest wave come rolling in, and we hear the roar of them. all	0
6391	philosopher has attempted to unite in a single whole, perhaps without	0
4050	so harry, thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last him a lifetime, buried himself once more among the dusty volumes, looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen.  however, though he, ron, and hermione searched through their lunchtimes, evenings, and whole weekends - though harry asked professor mcgonagall for a note of permission to use the restricted section, and even asked the irritable, vulture-like librarian.  madam pince, for help - they found nothing whatsoever that would enable harry to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale.	1
7954	as follows:--true art is not fanciful and imitative, but simple and	0

2035	he should be here any moment, said dumbledore.  would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle?	1
24813	things because he lightly touches on a small part of them, and that part	0
23961	also they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of justice?	0

13323	heads of a hydra; they multiply when they are cut off. the true remedy	0
211	he stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words.  he could almost see the cogs working under uncle vernon's thick, dark, neatly parted hair.  if he tried to stop harry writing to sirius, sirius would think harry was being mistreated.  if he told harry he couldn't go to the quidditch world cup, harry would write and tell sirius, who would know harry was being mistreated.  there was only one thing for uncle vernon to do.  harry could see the conclusion forming in his uncle's mind as though the great mustached face were transparent.  harry tried not to smile, to keep his own face as blank as possible. and then -	1
11043	proclamation; need we hire a herald, or shall i proclaim the result?	0
19899	the first place, that he is of the golden race?	0
18031	barbarians, though many that appear to be as great and many times	0
4079	yeah, you could've turned into a goldfish any time you wanted!  said ron.	1
13897	written by him at the age of about 34 or 35, and is full of the generous	0
1748	everyone was laughing - everyone except moody.	1
643	everyone, mr. weasley continued, this is ludo bagman, you know who he is, it's thanks to him we've got such good tickets -	1
2646	but this was a downright lie.  harry liked hermione very much, but she just wasn't the same as ron.  there was much hess laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when hermione was your best friend.  harry still hadn't mastered summoning charms, he seemed to have developed something of a block about them, and hermione insisted that learning the theory would help.  they consequently spent a lot of time poring over books during their lunchtimes.	1
9923	should be at first a sort of play, in which the natural bent is	0

4304	harry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up his ginger roots.  his hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his eyes down, as though he couldn't hear what snape was saying to him.	1
4136	as he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the dragons' enclosure in november were now ranged along the opposite bank, rising in stands that were packed to the bursting point and reflected in the lake below.  the excited babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water as harry ran flat-out around the other side of the lake toward the judges, who were sitting at another gold-draped table at the water's edge.  cedric, fleur, and krum were beside the judges' table, watching harry sprint toward them.	1

4538	hagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns, was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet.  harrys heart sank at the sight of the crates - surely not another skrewt hatching? - but when he got near enough to see inside, he found himself looking at a number of flurry black creatures with long snouts.  their front paws were curiously flat, like spades, and they were blinking up at the class, looking politely puzzled at all the attention.	1
20506	there is another point which should be remarked.	0
2778	i don't know, said sirius slowly, i just don't know...karkaroff doesn't strike me as the type who'd go back to voldemort unless he knew voldemort was powerful enough to protect him.  but whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason, and i can't help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to attack you and make it hook like an accident.	1

5903	harry had never seen professor mcgonagall lose control like this.  there were angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and a hands were balled into fists; she was trembling with fury.-	1

1094	of course it's not him, said mr. weasley impatiently. we don't know who it was; it looks like they disapparated.  now excuse me, please, i want to get to bed.	1

3578	they had reached a large stone reindeer now, over which they could see the sparkling jets of a tall fountain.  the shadowy outlines of two enormous people were visible on a stone bench, watching the water in the moonlight. and then harry heard hagrid speak.	1
1333	several of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed, including seamus finnigan, dean thomas, and neville longbottom, a round-faced, extremely forgetful boy who had been brought up by his formidable witch of a grandmother.  seamus was still wearing his ireland rosette.  some of its magic seemed to be wearing off now; it was still squeaking  troy - mullet - moran!  but in a very feeble and exhausted sort of way.  after half an hour or so, hermione, growing tired of the endless quidditch talk, buried herself once more in the standard book of spells, grade 4, and started trying to learn a summoning charm.	1
6190	as hagrid had said, what would come, would come ... and he would have to meet it when it did.	1

3535	for your information, he hasn't asked me one single thing about harry, not one -	1
3837	lying to hagrid wasn't quite like lying to anyone else.  harry went back to the castle later that afternoon with ron and hermione, unable to banish the image of the happy expression on hagrid's whiskery face as he had imagined harry winning the tournament.  the incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than ever on harrys conscience that evening, and by the time he had got into bed, he had made up his mind - it was time to shelve his pride and see if cedric's hint was worth anything.	1

9816	willing to speak in your lofty strain. no one can fail to see that the	0
9248	knowledge only, but of being, yet greater far than either in dignity	0
2829	never mind, said harry quickly - he knew hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth.  but i'm not the only one who knows.  fleur and krum will know by now - maxime and karkaroff both saw the dragons too.	1
180	p.s.  i do hope we've put enough stamps on.	1
2904	and in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be heard passing the tent, their owners talking excitedly, laughing, joking. . . . harry felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species.  and then - it seemed like about a second later to harry - bagman was opening the neck of the purple silk sack.	1

3015	right little ray of sunshine, aren't you?  said ron.  you and professor trelawney should get together sometime.	1
347	bill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook harry's hand.  bill came as something of a surprise.  harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank, gringotts, and that bill had been head boy at hogwarts; harry had always imagined bill to be an older version of percy:  fussy about rule-breaking and fond of bossing everyone around.  however, bill was - there was no other word for it - cool.  he was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail.  he was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it.  bill's clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert, except that harry recognized his boots to be made, not of leather, but of dragon hide.	1

4415	crouch let his son off?  i thought you had the measure of him, hermione!  anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming minister of magic.  you saw him dismiss a devoted house-elf because she associated him with the dark mark again - doesn't that tell you what he's like?  crouch's fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial, and by all accounts, it wasn't much more than an excuse for crouch to show how much he hated the boy . . . then he sent him straight to azkaban.	1

1818	shall we get our divination stuff, then?  said harry.	1

2603	 mr. ollivander spent much longer examining harry's wand than anyone else's. eventually, however, he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it back to harry, announcing that it was still in perfect condition.	1
18364	pleasures and desires; this is curiously enough implied in the saying of	0
2365	harry was able to answer that at once.  yes, someone wanted him dead, someone had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year old. . . lord voldemort.  but how could voldemort have ensured that harry's name got into the goblet of fire?  voldemort was supposed to be far away, in some distant country, in hiding, alone. . . feeble and powerless....	1

5248	harry, bill, and mrs. weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk around the castle, and then returned to the great hall for the evening feast.  ludo bagman and cornelius fudge had joined the staff table now.  bagman looked quite cheerful, but cornelius fudge, who was sitting next to madame maxime, looked stern and was not talking. madame maxime was concentrating on her plate, and harry thought her eyes looked red. hagrid kept glancing along the table at her,	1
23424	last of all comes the most beautiful of all, man and state alike,	0
21664	public or private life must have his eye fixed.	0

17735	therefore, as i was just now saying, we must enquire who are the best	0

9681	will distinguish between them, and will not laugh equally at both of	0

10074	pythagorean notions. there is no reason to suppose that he is speaking	0
12319	revolution, or taxation, or other legislative interference, were also	0
12433	recesses. the standard of health may be raised and the lives of men	0
18726	and if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from drink,	0
2448	predictably, malfoy arrived at hagrid's cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in place.	1
944	even by the feeble light of the two wands, harry could see that a great change had come over bagman.  he no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there was no more spring in his step.  he looked very white and strained.	1
9420	divisions of knowledge to one another and to the corresponding faculties	0
8285	that national character is of greater value than material comfort and	0

17260	and can recognise them and their images wherever they are found, not	0
2561	i didn't enter, said harry, starting to feel irritated.	1
2122	there was a much louder round of applause for bagman than for crouch, perhaps because of his fame as a beater, or simply because he looked so much more likable.  he acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand.  bartemius crouch did not smile or wave when his name was announced.  remembering him in his neat suit at the quidditch world cup, harry thought he looked strange in wizard's robes.  his toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to dumbledore's long white hair and beard.	1

13762	art of plato. the manners are clumsy and inferior; the hand of the	0
642	bagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard harry's name, and his eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar on harry's forehead.	1

8323	first then, of wisdom: the state which we have called into being will be	0

5454	voldemort looked away from harry and began examining his own body.  his hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cats, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness.  he held up his hands and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant.  he took not the slightest notice of wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling harry again, hissing. voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally long-fingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand.  he caressed it gently too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where harry was tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying.  voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh.	1
2599	aaaah, yes, said mr. ohlivander, his pale eyes suddenly gleaming.  yes, yes, yes. how well i remember.	1
5528	yes, said voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in harry's direction.  harry potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party.  one might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.	1
501	so how does everyone get there without all the muggles noticing? he asked.	1

15632	then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or	0
883	hermione and ginny came hurrying toward them, pulling coats over their nightdresses, with mr. weasley right behind them.  at the same moment, bill, charlie, and percy emerged from the boys' tent, fully dressed, with their sleeves rolled up and their wands out.	1
9761	thinking of the contradictions which arise in perception. the idea	0
2961	nice and easy does the trick, potter, he growled.	1

13263	gymnastic:--first, that the time of training is entirely separated from	0
2076	viktor krum and his fellow durmstrang students had settled themselves at the slytherin table.  harry could see malfoy, crabbe, and goyle looking very smug about this.  as he watched, malfoy bent forward to speak to krum.	1
758	everyone ready?  he said, his round face gleaming like a great, excited edam. minister - ready to go?	1
22880	who dwells in an ill-governed city, of which he declines the honours	0

5813	snape nodded silently and swept out of the room.	1
5200	s'pose so, harry said to ron; but just then. professor mcgonagall came walking alongside the gryffindor table toward him.	1
17145	and we have done wisely, he replied.	0
19463	certainly, the same principle holds; but why does this involve any	0
12321	character. the early christians are believed to have held their property	0
18661	drink, and of drink only; not of drink qualified by anything else; for	0
4874	he was riding on the back of an eagle owl, soaring through the clear blue sky toward an old, ivy-covered house set high on a hillside.  lower and lower they flew, the wind blowing pleasantly in harry's face, until they reached a dark and broken window in the upper story of the house and entered.  now they were flying along a gloomy passageway, to a room at the very end . . . through the door they went, into a dark room whose windows were boarded up....	1
15724	honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty; and they	0
18563	once more then, o my friend, we have alighted upon an easy	0
20459	truthfulness: they will never intentionally receive into their mind	0

3337	she's part veela, said harry.  you were right - her grandmother was one.  it wasn't your fault, i bet you just walked past when she was turning on the old charm for diggory and got a blast of it - but she was wasting her time.  he's going with cho chang.	1

3443	harry's other presents were much more satisfactory than dobby's odd socks - with the obvious exception of the dursleys', which consisted of a single tissue, an all-time low - harry supposed they too were remember ing the ton-tongue toffee.  hermione had given harry a book called quidditch teams of britain and ireland; ron, a bulging bag of dungbombs; sirius, a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot; and hagrid, a vast box of sweets including all harrys favorites:  bertie bott's every flavor beans, chocolate frogs, drooble's best blowing gum, and fizzing whizbees.  there was also, of course, mrs. weasley's usual package, including a new sweater (green, with a picture of a dragon on it - harry supposed charlie had told her all about the horntail), and a large quantity of homemade mince pies.	1

431	in the middle of the table, mrs. weasley was arguing with bill about his earring, which seemed to be a recent acquisition.	1

4696	the stone wall behind snape slid open.  dumbledore was standing there, wearing long green robes and a mildly curious expression.  is there a problem? he said, looking between harry and snape.	1
167	so, he said, marching over to the fireplace and turning to face harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest.  so.	1

1185	mrs. weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner.  harry liked this clock.  it was completely useless if you wanted to know the time, but otherwise very informative.  it had nine golden hands, and each of them was engraved with one of the weasley family's names. there were no numerals around the face, but descriptions of where each family member might be. home, school, and work were there, but there was also traveling, lost, hospital, prison, and, in the position where the number twelve would be on a normal clock, mortal peril.	1
2263	there was no applause.  a buzzing, as though of angry bees, was starting to fill the hall; some students were standing up to get a better look at harry as he sat, frozen, in his seat.	1

11318	nor could he have made more than one; for if there had been two, there	0

3449	harry, ron, seamus, dean, and neville changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them looking very self-conscious, but none as much as ron, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face.  there was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else.  in a desperate attempt to make them look more manly, he used a severing charm on the ruff and cuffs.  it worked fairly well; at least he was now lace-free, although he hadn't done a very neat job, and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs.	1

818	now, we can't have that! said ludo bagman, though he sounded highly amused. somebody slap the referee!	1

2235	when they entered the candlelit great hall it was almost full.  the goblet of fire had been moved; it was now standing in front of dumbledore's empty chair at the teachers' table. fred and george - clean-shaven again - seemed to have taken their disappointment fairly well.	1
8673	a cobbler a hairy man ought not to be a cobbler. now why is such an	0

16554	told, and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth	0
4938	he felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in dumbledore's office, knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream.  harry looked up at the walls behind the desk.  the patched and ragged sorting hat was standing on a shelf.  a glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the hilt, which harry recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of the sorting hat in his second year.  the sword had once belonged to godric gryffindor, founder of harry's house.  he was gazing at it, remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the glass case.  he looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of silver-white shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him, whose door had not been closed properly.  harry hesitated, glanced at fawkes, then got up, walked across the office, and pulled open the cabinet door.	1
328	you aren't going to see your nephew till next summer, he said to uncle vernon in mild indignation.  surely you're going to say good-bye?	1
1652	 and there's a picture, weasley!  said malfoy, flipping the paper over and holding it up.  a picture of your parents outside their house - if you can call it a house!  your mother could do with losing a bit of weight, couldn't she?	1

10547	and he can get rid of bolder spirits by handing them over to the enemy.	0
20758	now what opinion of any other sophist, or of any private person, can be	0

3904	er . . . i'll try, harry said, though privately thinking the only way he'd be visiting myrtle's bathroom again was if every other toilet in the castle got blocked.  see you.  myrtle... thanks for your help.	1
7026	those who are injured are not necessarily made worse, but only harmed or	0

17148	the same rules, for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre,	0
3642	ron looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly, but perhaps he didn't want another row, because he contented himself with shaking his head disbelievingly while hermione wasn't looking.	1

3611	well... no one who knows him will care, 'cos they'll know he's not dangerous, said ron slowly.  but. . . harry, they're just vicious, giants.  it's like hagrid said, it's in their natures, they're like trolls . . . they just like killing, everyone knows that.  there aren't any left in britain now, though.	1

4764	it was daybreak. harry, ron, and hermione had crept out of their dormitories very early and hurried up to the owlery together to send a note to sirius.  now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds.  all three of them were puffy-eyed and pale because they had been talking late into the night about mr. crouch.	1

5432	it was as though wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed something ugly, slimy, and blind - but worse, a hundred times worse.  the thing wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child, except that harry had never seen anything less like a child.  it was hairless and scaly-looking, a dark, raw, reddish black.  its arms and legs were thin and feeble, and its face - no child alive ever had a face like that - flat and snakelike, with gleaming red eyes.	1
3710	but it seemed that hagrid did care.  they didn't see a sign of him all week.  he didn't appear at the staff table at mealtimes, they didn't see him going about his gamekeeper duties on the grounds, and professor grubbly-plank continued to take the care of magical creatures classes.  malfoy was gloating at every possible opportunity.	1
613	there was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field.  harry, ron, and hermione joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument.  one of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown.  the other was clearly a ministry wizard; he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation.	1

5713	you were so long in that lake, potter, i thought you had drowned.  but luckily, dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility, and marked you high for it.  i breathed again.	1
540	harry looked up. mr. weasley, mr. diggory, and cedric were still standing, though looking very windswept; everybody else was on the ground.	1
1168	oh harry, you aren't going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says?	1

6639	urges at the beginning of the fourth book that socrates fails in making	0
